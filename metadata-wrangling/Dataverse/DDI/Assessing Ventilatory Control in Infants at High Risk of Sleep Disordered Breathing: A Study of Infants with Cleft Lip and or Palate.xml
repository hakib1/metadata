            <abstract>The objective of this study was to determine the impact of sleep disordered breathing (SDB) in early infancy on ventilatory response in infants. We recruited consecutive infants with cleft lip and/or palate (CL/P) to undergo ventilatory response testing using exposure to a hypoxic (15% O(2) ) gas mixture during sleep. This population is at high risk of SDB because of smaller airway caliber and abnormal palatal muscle attachments predisposing them to airway obstruction of ranging severity from birth.</abstract>

               <sampProc>The target subject number was 20. It was chosen based on the number of subjects in previous studies in this area, as the absence of an estimated effect size precluded sample size calculations. The actual sample size was 22. The sample was chosen through consecutive screening and enrollment; all families with infants born with (CL/P) at the Children's Hospital at Westmead during the time of the study were approached to participate</sampProc>
