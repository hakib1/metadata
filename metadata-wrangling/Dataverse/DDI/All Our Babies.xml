            <abstract>The All Our Babies (AOB) study is a prospective community-based pregnancy cohort that follows maternal-infant pairs across the early life course to describes the mental health and psychosocial characteristics of mothers living in Calgary and area, as well as estimating rates of low birth weight, small for gestational age and preterm births. This study is intended to help understand women's prenatal care experiences in Calgary and identify barriers and facilitators to accessing care. AOB data covers subject areas including: a) Maternal Prenatal Health (e.g., prenatal care, maternal gestation); b) Pregnancy History (e.g., previous pregnancies, previous preterm birth); c) Pre-pregnancy (e.g., pregnancy planning advice received, contraception use, pregnancy intention); d) Health Care Services (e.g., utilization of services for mother and baby); e) Food, Exercise and Housing (e.g., nutrition, housing, neighbourhood safety and cohesion); f) Lifestyle (e.g., T-ACE Screen for alcohol consumption risk, smoking, drugs); g) Social Support (Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Scale, partner/relationship satisfaction); h) Mental Health (e.g., Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, Spielberger State Anxiety Scale, Perceived Stress Scale, optimism [Life Orientation Test-Revised]); i) Life Events (e.g., previous mental health, abuse); j) Sociodemographic Outcomes (e.g., age, marital status, education, ethnicity, work status); k) Birth Outcomes - maternal and delivery (e.g. site of birth, delivery type, medication, delivery support); l) Birth Outcomes -infant (e.g., sex, birth weight, gestational age); m) Baby Health/Development (e.g., doctor, check-up, vaccinations); n) Parenting/ Postpartum Experiences (e.g. Parenting Morale Index, breastfeeding [Montreal Children's Hospital Feeding Scale], community service utilization)</abstract>
