            <abstract>The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of a cardiology clinic-based educational intervention for 15 to 17 year teens with congenital heart disease (CHD), and to determine whether this intervention results in improved self-management skills, teens having greater knowledge of their heart condition, and more teen satisfaction with services. The study showed that an individualised nurse-led teaching session for older adolescents with heart disease results in improved knowledge of their heart and greater self-management skills relative to controls.</abstract>

               <sampProc>Anticipating a mean TRAQ self-management baseline score of 3.01 (SD 1.02) (out of a possible 5.0) as reported for adolescents without a transition intervention and an anticipated mean score of 4.0 post-intervention resulting in a change score of 1 (ie, 1 SD), with ?=0.05 and 90% power, 23 patients in each intervention group (total of 46) is required. Assuming that 30% of participants would either withdraw or not complete the 6-month TRAQ questionnaire, the target sample size was 60 study participants. The actual number of study participants was 58. Patients were assigned to groups through block randomization with the unit of randomization being week.</sampProc>

               <collSitu>Adolescents in the intervention group took part in a one-on-one teaching session about health-related decision-making, self-advocacy, and lifestyle issues provided by a nurse. They filled out a 'MyHealth Passport' with information about their health. The study nurse also completed a log and field notes to document any difficulties that were encountered during the intervention and the participant's reaction, level of engagement, questions and body language. Adolescents in the control group received standard of care. They saw a nurse only to measure weight, height, and blood pressure and relied on their cardiologist for information about their heart condition.    All adolescents completed three short questionnaires at the start of the study, and completed them again 1 month later and 6 months later. The follow-up questionnaires were either mailed to participants or done via the internet.    Medical charts were reviewed only for information about participants' heart condition, such as the name of the heart condition, cardiac operations or procedures, cardiac medications, cardiology clinic notes, and inpatient notes for cardiac problems. A nursing log and text and email follow-up of the transition intervention will also be analysed. Upon completing the study questionnaires at the 1 month and 6 month intervals participants were sent a $25 gift certificate.</collSitu>
