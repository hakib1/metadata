            <abstract>This is a prospective, multi-centre, concurrent mixed methods study comprised of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) and an interpretive descriptive qualitative design. The goal of the RCT is to compare: 1) a walking training program with the Lokomat robotic device (LOK), 2) a functional physical therapy program (fPT) that includes activities to enhance balance/co-ordination/endurance and advanced motor skills conducted over 'real ground', 3) a combined Lokomat + functional physical therapy (LOK+fPT) program, and 4) a regular maintenance therapy condition (CONT). The qualitative part of the study will consist of interviews of children and parents after they have finished the study intervention.</abstract>

               <sampProc>RCT: The sample size of 144 children represents 9 children per age group (less than 13y; 13 to 18y), GMFCS strata, and intervention combination. An additional 16 participants will be recruited to accommodate an estimated 10 % drop out rate (144/.9) for a total of 160. The 10 % drop out rate was based on the current 7 % drop out rate in the feasibility trial conducted at Holland Bloorview. Sample size calculations were based on pre- to post-intervention change on the primary outcome (Gross Motor Function Measure-66) (GMFM-66) and a two-factor factorial design (F tests). PASS software was used to calculate sample size.   Qualitative: Target sample size: 18 RCT participant child-parent dyads (6 dyads from each site) and 3 parents from each site who declined participation in the RCT. The estimated sample size is based on theoretical understanding of the complexity and variability of the data.</sampProc>
               <frequenc>RCT: Data will be collected at baseline, and at 8 weeks and 20 weeks. The three intervention programs will consist of sixteen 50-minute sessions given twice weekly over 8 to 10 weeks.  Qualitative: Participating parents and children in the RCT will be interviewed within 1 month of intervention completion.</frequenc>

               <collSitu>Qualitative component: Individual interviews with parents (and their children for those in the RCT) will be conducted. Parents will participate in 45-60 min semi-structured, individual interviews conducted by one member of the research team. Children will be interviewed for 20-45 minutes. Data sources will be digital recordings, transcribed text of all interviews, and field notes created by the interviewers. All data will be entered into REDCap, a secure, web-based application for building and managing online research projects.</collSitu>
               <actMin>Calls will be made to participants before their appointments.</actMin>
               <ConOps>Assessments will be video-recorded and a random sample of 20 % of the assessment's video-recordings will be scored by an independent assessor who will not be aware of assessment sequence order. This double scoring will be done through the study to flag any scoring issues and allow remedial action.</ConOps>
