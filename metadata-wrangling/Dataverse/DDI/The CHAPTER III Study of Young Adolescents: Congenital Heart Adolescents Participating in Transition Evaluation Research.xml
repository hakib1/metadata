            <abstract>The CHAPTER III Study is a cluster randomized controlled trial evaluating the impact of a nurse-led transition intervention in combination with usual care, versus usual care alone, on preparing adolescents with congenital heart disease (CHD) to successfully transition from pediatric to adult cardiology care. The investigators propose to conduct a nurse-led intervention that addresses the educational needs of 13-14 year old adolescents.</abstract>

               <collSitu>Adolescents in the intervention group will take part in a one-on-one session about health-related decision-making, self-advocacy, and lifestyle issues provided by a nurse.  Sessions be youth-oriented, interactive, and engaging. This session will be held in conjunction with a scheduled pediatric cardiology clinic visit and. They will be encouraged to contact the RN at a study email address or by text messaging with follow-up questions. Adolescents in the control group will received standard of care. They will see a nurse only to measure weight, height, and blood pressure and relied on their cardiologist for information about their heart condition.    Youth will complete the MyHeart Scale and the TRANSITION-Q Questionnaire in the clinic area at enrollment for the 'usual care' group, and prior to intervention for the 'intervention' group. Both groups will repeat the questionnaires 1 month and 6 months post enrollment.    Medical charts will be reviewed only for information about participants' heart condition, such as date of birth, CHD diagnosis, names and dates of cardiac surgical procedures and cardiac catheterizations, current use of cardiac medications (Y/N), history of missed appointments (Y/N), and cardiologist's name. As well, nursing logs and texts and emails between nurses and study participants will be collected and analysed.</collSitu>
