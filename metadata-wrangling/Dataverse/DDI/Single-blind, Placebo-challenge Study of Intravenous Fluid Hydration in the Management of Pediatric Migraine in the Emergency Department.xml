               <collSitu>Baseline characteristics included age, weight, sex, Pediatric Migraine Disability Assessment (PedMIDAS) (migraine disability), duration of headache prior to ED presentation, number of migraine attacks in last 3 months, prior pain medications, prophylactic medication, history of syncope, history of dizziness, proportion with emesis at presentation, baseline frequency of emesis, and estimated fluid intake in previous 24 hours. The primary outcome assessment was the mean change from baseline on the visual analog scale (VAS) at 30 minutes. In addition, other pain assessment scales were used to assess their correlation including the five-faces pain scale and the four-level pain scale (ie, none, mild, moderate, and severe). Secondary outcome measures included pain-free status at 30 minutes, headache relief calculated as a change from baseline of greater than or equal to 33%, headache relief calculated as a 50% change from baseline, meaningful headache relief defined as a change from baseline of 30?mm or more, nausea as assessed using the VAS, return to the ED, hospital admission, patient satisfaction, and adverse events. All participants received standard care chosen by the treating ED physician following the initial IV fluid assessment phase. Prior to discharge, the participants were asked about the level of satisfaction with their overall treatment. Participants were also followed up by telephone at 24 hours to assess for adverse events, return to ED, and satisfaction with treatment.</collSitu>
