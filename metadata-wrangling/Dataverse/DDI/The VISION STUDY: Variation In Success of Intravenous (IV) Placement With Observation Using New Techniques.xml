            <abstract>Children fear having an intravenous (IV) needle placed because of the pain that they will experience. The more needle punctures that a child has to endure before the IV is successfully placed, the greater the pain experienced and anxiety suffered. In addition, false starts increase the demands on medical staff and can increase the length of the  emergency department stay. Often, veins are difficult to see or feel, particularly in an unwell, dehydrated child or in young infants who have more fat below the skin surface. Also, the venous pattern below the skin surface naturally varies from person to person and therefore success in placing IVs leaves room for improvement. Technology may be able to play an important role is improving the rates of success. The investigators investigated whether the use of either an Ultrasound machine or a VeinViewer machine can improve the rate of success of the initial attempt (skin puncture) at peripheral IV placement in comparison to the current standard approach.</abstract>

               <sampProc>The 418 study participants came from a convenience sample of all eligible children whose primary nurse agreed to participate in the study.

               <collSitu>All procedures were performed in private treatment rooms under standard fluorescent lighting. Standard techniques to facilitate intravenous  catheterization were used. The research assistant recorded baseline and multiple prospective outcome variables. Times were recorded by stopwatch. Intravenous catheterization was attempted until it was either successful or was abandoned as per routine clinical decision-making.</collSitu>
