            <dataColl>
               <sampProc>There were 103 participants who were born preterm and 64 control children in this follow-up study. Initial contact with families of EP born children was by letter with follow-up phone calls. After agreement to participate, families were asked if they could identify a friend of their child who was born at term, healthy and interested in participating. Friends were scheduled on the same activity day. Additional community controls were recruited through key contacts and poster advertisements.</sampProc>
               <frequenc>Data was collected at one time point.</frequenc>

               <collMode>Chart review; Physiological measurements and tests</collMode>
               <collSitu>All families with a participating child were mailed a package of questionnaires prior to the activity day. This included the Child Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ); Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ) - Parent Report; Child Behaviour Check List (CBCL); Parent Pediatric Quality of Life Survey (PedsQL); Child Pediatric Quality of Life Survey (PedsQL); Adolescent Pediatric Quality of Life Survey (PedsQL); and the Asthma Pediatric Quality of Life Survey (PedsQL). On the activity day children completed lung function testing, including spirometry, lung volumes and diffusion capacity, and cardio-pulmonary exercise testing (CPET) using a cycle ergometer.     A sub-set of children completed additional testing including oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) response testing, echocardiography, and quality of life interviews. If additional testing could not be completed in a single day, families were asked if they were willing to return on a separated day for echocardiography. Some quality of life interviews were completed by phone.    Medical chart review was completed for children born EP. This was restricted to the child's NICU chart which included a copy of the delivery record and included both free text and tabulated data. The data extraction was carried out by experienced neonatal research nurses.    Height was recorded, without shoes, using a fixed stadiometer. Weight was measured with exercise clothing, without shoes, using a digital scale. Height, weight and body mass index (BMI) were converted to z-scores using normative data from the Centre for Disease Control.</collSitu>

               <cleanOps>Outliers were checked and validated. Families were contacted if data was missing.</cleanOps>
