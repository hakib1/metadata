            <abstract>Due to recent efforts to decrease antibiotic overuse, and reports of high rates of spontaneous resolution for clinically diagnosed Acute Otitis Media, most physicians now wait 48-72 hours before starting antibiotics for common ear infections. The investigators are interested to see if those patients with documented middle ear effusions, as determined by tympanometry, have higher rates of eventual antibiotic usage than those with normal tympanometry results. If there is a significant disparity between those with a positive tympanogram and those without the investigators may be able to identify a group that will benefit from antibiotics and a group that would not need treatment.</abstract>

               <sampProc>Convenience Sample: All patients diagnosed with Otitis Media will be approached for study enrollment within the hours a research assistant is available. A logistic regression will be performed using antibiotic use in 7 days as the dependent variable. Given 4 independent variables, the investigators need at least 40 (80 would be ideal) subjects who fill the antibiotic prescription. Enrolling 137 patients would give an alpha and beta each of 0.05, and would allow investigators to do Chi Squared test looking at a two by two table of Antibiotic (Yes or No) vs Tympanometry Graph (Type B vs other).</sampProc>

               <collSitu>All patients diagnosed with OM will be approached for study enrollment within the hours which an RA is available. Tympanometry will be conducted on every participant in both ears. The clinician will not be privy to the result of the tympanogram. The tympanograms will be assigned a B or A/C shape, upon review by the principle investigators. In cases of disagreement a third reviewer will review the tympanogram.  Patients will be followed with a phone call after 3 days and again at 8 days. They will be asked to rate their symptoms (Acute Otitis Media-Severity of Symptom Scale), in addition to specific scripted interview questions for the study including a determination of antibiotic usage for the infection. The provincial pharmacy database will also be reviewed to confirm if antibiotics prescriptions were filled.</collSitu>
