  <description>Title from cover</description>
  <description>An annual audit program, involving submissions of data from municipalities to Alberta Municipal Affairs, checks for compliance with regulated assessment standards. The annual submission contains the information about every assessable property in the municipality for the purposes of conducting the annual audit and for determining the equalized assessment. The main section of this manual describes the following: how that information is to be submitted to the ministry's Computer Assisted Mass Appraisal system; and the steps of the annual audit process, including collection &amp; processing of property sales data, sales price adjustments, matching sale data to assessment data, stratification of data, and use of standardized codes. The final sections briefly review scheduled detailed assessment audits, the declaration prepared by the assessor, reporting of linear property assessments, and the municipal audit &amp; assessment process</description>
