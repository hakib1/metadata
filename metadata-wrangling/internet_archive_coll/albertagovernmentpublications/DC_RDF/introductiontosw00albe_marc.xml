   <dc:description>Swath grazing is a management technique that's growing in popularity with mature beef cattle producers in Western Canada. Late-seeded annuals are swathed in mid-September in the soft dough stage and left for cattle to graze during the winter. Allowing livestock to obtain all or part of their feed through swath grazing extends the grazing season and reduces winter feed costs and the cost of corral cleaning and manure spreading.</dc:description>
