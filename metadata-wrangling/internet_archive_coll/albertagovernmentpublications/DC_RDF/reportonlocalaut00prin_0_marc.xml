   <dc:description>The Honourable Rob Renner, Minister of Municipal Affairs, committed to an enhanced review of the Local Authorities Election Act and its regulations, after the October 18, 2004 general elections. This enhanced review, led by an MLA committee, focused on local election procedures and issues, including voter identification and lists, special ballots, campaign advertising, and terms of office. The Committee was also responsible for reviewing the recommendations of the Clark Inspection Report, which looked into alleged irregularities in the 2004 Calgary Ward 10 election.</dc:description>
