   <dc:description>The protocol was developed in response to a recommendation in the Report of the Alberta Victims of Crime Consultation, 2002, accepted by the Alberta Legislature in 2004.</dc:description>
   <dc:description>The protocol outlines what you can expect throughout the criminal justice process, from the time you report a crime through the police investigation, court proceedings and, if the accused is found guilty, provincial and federal corrections and the National Parole Board. The protocol also tells what is expected of you and what else you can do when you are in contact with the criminal justice system.</dc:description>
