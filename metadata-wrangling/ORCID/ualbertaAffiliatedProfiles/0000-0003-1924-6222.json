She has dual master’s degree in Physics and Materials Science and Engineering from Kurukshetra and Thapar University, respectively. She was a merit holder in both her master’s degrees and received silver medal for obtaining first rank in M. Sc. Physics (2002-2003). She received her Ph D degree in Physics from Indian Institute of Technology Delhi in 2012. Her Ph D work deals with growth, structure and electron emission characteristics of carbon nanotubes and nanostructures synthesized by MPECVD. She has published 11 international journal papers and 12 conference papers during her Ph D.\r\nPresently, she is working as a postdoctoral fellow in  in NRC-NINT, University of Alberta Canada. Her present research interests are growth and photocatalytic properties of novel TiO2 nanotubes and nanostructures.\r\n","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0003-1924-6222/biography"},"researcher-urls":{"last-modified-date":null,"researcher-url":[],"path":"/0000-0003-1924-6222/researcher-urls"},"emails":{"last-modified-date":null,"email":[],"path":"/0000-0003-1924-6222/email"},"addresses":{"last-modified-date":null,"address":[],"path":"/0000-0003-1924-6222/address"},"keywords":{"last-modified-date":{"value":1395705269510},"keyword":[{"created-date":{"value":1395705269510},"last-modified-date":{"value":1395705269510},"source":{"source-orcid":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1924-6222","path":"0000-0003-1924-6222","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"Himani Sharma"}},"content":"Carbon Nanotubes, Graphene, novel TiO2 nanostructures, Raman Spectroscopy, Photocatalysis, Field Emission","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0003-1924-6222/keywords/94381","put-code":94381,"display-index":0}],"path":"/0000-0003-1924-6222/keywords"},"external-identifiers":{"last-modified-date":null,"external-identifier":[],"path":"/0000-0003-1924-6222/external-identifiers"},"path":"/0000-0003-1924-6222/person"}
