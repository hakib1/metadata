I lead the RMoD team http://rmod.lille.inria.fr. \n\nI'm expert in two domains: object-oriented language design and reengineering.  \n\n- I worked on traits, composable groups of methods. Traits have been introduced in  Pharo, Perl, PHP and  under a variant into Scala, Fortress of SUN Microsystems.  \n- I'm also expert on software quality, program understanding, program visualisations, reengineering and metamodeling. I'm one of the developer of Moose, an open-source software analysis platform http://www.moosetechnology.org/.  I created http://www.synectique.eu/ a company building dedicated tools for advanced software analysis. \n\nI'm one of the leader of Pharo  http://www.pharo.org/ a dynamic reflective object-oriented language supporting live programming. The objective of Pharo is to create an ecosystem where innovation and business bloom. Pharo is used by 30 Universities worldwide, 16 research groups and around 50 companies. \n\nI wrote several books such as Functional Programming in Scheme, Pharo by Example, Entreprise Pharo: a Web Perspective, Deep into Pharo, Object-oriented Reengineering Patterns, Dynamic web development with Seaside. \nI wrote many research articles: According to google my h-index is around 51.\nMore information on http://stephane.ducasse.free.fr \n\nPS: I find a bit strange to have to duplicate all over the webservices such information so it will be obsolete soon but this is life.","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0001-6070-6599/biography"},"researcher-urls":{"last-modified-date":{"value":1470554236930},"researcher-url":[{"created-date":{"value":1426622743185},"last-modified-date":{"value":1470554236930},"source":{"source-orcid":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6070-6599","path":"0000-0001-6070-6599","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"Stéphane Ducasse"}},"url-name":"http://stephane.ducasse.free.fr","url":{"value":"http://stephane.ducasse.free.fr"},"visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0001-6070-6599/researcher-urls/429623","put-code":429623,"display-index":3},{"created-date":{"value":1426622788960},"last-modified-date":{"value":1470554236930},"source":{"source-orcid":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6070-6599","path":"0000-0001-6070-6599","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"Stéphane Ducasse"}},"url-name":"http://www.pharo.org","url":{"value":"http://www.pharo.org"},"visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0001-6070-6599/researcher-urls/429625","put-code":429625,"display-index":2},{"created-date":{"value":1470554236921},"last-modified-date":{"value":1470554236921},"source":{"source-orcid":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6070-6599","path":"0000-0001-6070-6599","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"Stéphane Ducasse"}},"url-name":"http://rmod.lille.inria.fr","url":{"value":"http://rmod.lille.inria.fr"},"visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0001-6070-6599/researcher-urls/777671","put-code":777671,"display-index":1}],"path":"/0000-0001-6070-6599/researcher-urls"},"emails":{"last-modified-date":null,"email":[],"path":"/0000-0001-6070-6599/email"},"addresses":{"last-modified-date":{"value":1469438541914},"address":[{"created-date":{"value":1469438541914},"last-modified-date":{"value":1469438541914},"source":{"source-orcid":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6070-6599","path":"0000-0001-6070-6599","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"Stéphane Ducasse"}},"country":{"value":"FR"},"visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0001-6070-6599/address/503800","put-code":503800,"display-index":1}],"path":"/0000-0001-6070-6599/address"},"keywords":{"last-modified-date":{"value":1426622862173},"keyword":[{"created-date":{"value":1426622862173},"last-modified-date":{"value":1426622862173},"source":{"source-orcid":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6070-6599","path":"0000-0001-6070-6599","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"Stéphane Ducasse"}},"content":"software engineering program understanding visualization metamodelling software analysis maintenance tools dynamically-typed languages reflective programming traits modules pharo","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0001-6070-6599/keywords/339093","put-code":339093,"display-index":0}],"path":"/0000-0001-6070-6599/keywords"},"external-identifiers":{"last-modified-date":null,"external-identifier":[],"path":"/0000-0001-6070-6599/external-identifiers"},"path":"/0000-0001-6070-6599/person"}
