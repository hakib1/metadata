Before joining University of Alberta, I was an assistant professor in Guanghua School of Management of Peking University.\n\nMy research focuses on household finance, urban and real estate. I have also carried out some studies on human capital accumulation, labor supply and home production. The main approach is quantitative macro, emphasizing that a dynamic macro model should be able to deliver key statistics found in the data, especially in micro data from various sources.","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0003-2935-872X/biography"},"researcher-urls":{"last-modified-date":null,"researcher-url":[],"path":"/0000-0003-2935-872X/researcher-urls"},"emails":{"last-modified-date":null,"email":[],"path":"/0000-0003-2935-872X/email"},"addresses":{"last-modified-date":{"value":1498771150389},"address":[{"created-date":{"value":1498771150389},"last-modified-date":{"value":1498771150389},"source":{"source-orcid":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2935-872X","path":"0000-0003-2935-872X","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"Guozhong Zhu"}},"country":{"value":"CA"},"visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0003-2935-872X/address/736115","put-code":736115,"display-index":1}],"path":"/0000-0003-2935-872X/address"},"keywords":{"last-modified-date":{"value":1498771191825},"keyword":[{"created-date":{"value":1498771191824},"last-modified-date":{"value":1498771191825},"source":{"source-orcid":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2935-872X","path":"0000-0003-2935-872X","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"Guozhong Zhu"}},"content":"Urban, Real Estate, Household Finance, Macroeconomics","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0003-2935-872X/keywords/735999","put-code":735999,"display-index":1}],"path":"/0000-0003-2935-872X/keywords"},"external-identifiers":{"last-modified-date":null,"external-identifier":[],"path":"/0000-0003-2935-872X/external-identifiers"},"path":"/0000-0003-2935-872X/person"}
