During his part-time study at the University of London, he worked full time as a research scientist at the British Non-ferrous Metals Research Association, in London. He co-authored with Mr. John Ward on several research papers on Chromium plating and got patents for “ black Chrome Electroplating”. Later he was admitted to the Royal Institute of Chemistry, as an associate member of the Royal Institute of Chemistry (A.R.I.C). \n\nSubsequently, he immigrated to Edmonton, Alberta to continue his studies in Analytical Chemistry as a Ph. D candidate, at the University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada. While pursuing his Ph.D program, he worked as a research assistant and teaching assistant at the university of Alberta. However, as a result of financial constraints he was forced to discontinue his Ph.D program. \n\nMr. Pillai held many sales and management positions in the Edmonton area for several organizations and was a sought-after sales professional by recruiting agents. He received the top financial consultant title from Merrill Lynch Canada. During 2003 he retired from Berlex Canada and started two businesses named Wellness Hypnotherapy Clinic Inc. and Wellness Hypnotherapy Institute. Both these businesses are thriving in Edmonton as a result of dedication, hard work and his client centered approach. \n\nMr. Pillai became a healing Master student in 2010, after receiving a life transforming Biofield energy transmission (Trivedi Effect) from Mahendra Kumar Trivedi (many lovingly call him Guruji). He currently practices Hypnotherapy and healing using bio-field energy transmissions. \n\nTo further prove the efficacy and validity of the “Trivedi Effect”, Guruji, with his compassion, wanted to test the authenticity of the “Trivedi effect” through his Healing Master students in the arena of Science. Mr. Pillai was one of the participants in the Healing Masters group-2, during these science experiments conducted by a well-known third party scientific organization.","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0002-5240-9399/biography"},"researcher-urls":{"last-modified-date":{"value":1481201041113},"researcher-url":[{"created-date":{"value":1481201041113},"last-modified-date":{"value":1481201041113},"source":{"source-orcid":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5240-9399","path":"0000-0002-5240-9399","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"Padmanabha Narayana Pillai"}},"url-name":null,"url":{"value":"http://trivediscience.com/"},"visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0002-5240-9399/researcher-urls/938135","put-code":938135,"display-index":1}],"path":"/0000-0002-5240-9399/researcher-urls"},"emails":{"last-modified-date":null,"email":[],"path":"/0000-0002-5240-9399/email"},"addresses":{"last-modified-date":{"value":1481201129464},"address":[{"created-date":{"value":1481200979856},"last-modified-date":{"value":1481201129464},"source":{"source-orcid":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5240-9399","path":"0000-0002-5240-9399","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"Padmanabha Narayana Pillai"}},"country":{"value":"CA"},"visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0002-5240-9399/address/589067","put-code":589067,"display-index":1}],"path":"/0000-0002-5240-9399/address"},"keywords":{"last-modified-date":{"value":1481201011565},"keyword":[{"created-date":{"value":1481201011555},"last-modified-date":{"value":1481201011555},"source":{"source-orcid":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5240-9399","path":"0000-0002-5240-9399","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"Padmanabha Narayana Pillai"}},"content":"Biofield","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0002-5240-9399/keywords/590280","put-code":590280,"display-index":3},{"created-date":{"value":1481201011563},"last-modified-date":{"value":1481201011563},"source":{"source-orcid":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5240-9399","path":"0000-0002-5240-9399","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"Padmanabha Narayana Pillai"}},"content":"Biofield Treatment","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0002-5240-9399/keywords/590281","put-code":590281,"display-index":2},{"created-date":{"value":1481201011565},"last-modified-date":{"value":1481201011565},"source":{"source-orcid":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5240-9399","path":"0000-0002-5240-9399","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"Padmanabha Narayana Pillai"}},"content":"Trivedi Effect","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0002-5240-9399/keywords/590282","put-code":590282,"display-index":1}],"path":"/0000-0002-5240-9399/keywords"},"external-identifiers":{"last-modified-date":null,"external-identifier":[],"path":"/0000-0002-5240-9399/external-identifiers"},"path":"/0000-0002-5240-9399/person"}
