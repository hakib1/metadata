I then spent two and a half years as a postdoctoral fellow in the gravitational physics group at Penn State University, followed by a four-year stint as a senior postdoctoral fellow and then a senior research fellow at the California Institute of Technology. I joined the faculty of Cardiff University as a senior lecturer in June 2007, and was promoted to Reader in 2012.","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0003-1614-3922/biography"},"researcher-urls":{"last-modified-date":null,"researcher-url":[],"path":"/0000-0003-1614-3922/researcher-urls"},"emails":{"last-modified-date":null,"email":[],"path":"/0000-0003-1614-3922/email"},"addresses":{"last-modified-date":null,"address":[],"path":"/0000-0003-1614-3922/address"},"keywords":{"last-modified-date":null,"keyword":[],"path":"/0000-0003-1614-3922/keywords"},"external-identifiers":{"last-modified-date":null,"external-identifier":[],"path":"/0000-0003-1614-3922/external-identifiers"},"path":"/0000-0003-1614-3922/person"}
