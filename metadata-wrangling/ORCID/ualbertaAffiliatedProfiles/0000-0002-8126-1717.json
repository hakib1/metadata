Cheriton School of Computer Science at the University of Waterloo. Prior to joining University of Waterloo in 2000, I was with the University of Alberta, Department of Computing Science (1984-2000). I served as the Director of the Cheriton School from January 2007 until June 2010, and as Associate Dean (Research) of the Faculty of Mathematics from January 2014 until June 2016.\n\nMy research interest is in data management with a focus on data distribution, and management of unconventional data. The unconventional data I currently study are graphs and RDF. In the past, I studied multimedia data, XML, spatial data and others. \n\nI am the Editor-in-Chief of ACM Books (http://books.acm.org), and the Co-Editor-in-Chief of the Encyclopedia of Database Systems (Springer, 2009; second edition forthcoming). I serve on the editorial boards of World Wide Web Journal, Journal of Information and Data Management, and International Journal of Next-Generation Computing, and Springer Book Series on Advanced Information & Knowledge Processing and Web Information Systems Engineering and Internet Technologies. I was the Founding Editor of Synthesis Lectures on Data Management (Morgan & Claypool - 2009 until 2014).\n\nI serve on the ACM Publications Board. In the past, I served as the Chair of ACM Special Interest Group on Management of Data (SIGMOD) (2001-2005), member of the Board of Computing Research Association (CRA) (2010-2013), an Editor-in-Chief of The VLDB Journal (1997-2005), and a trustee of the VLDB Endowment (1996-2002). I have also served on the Editorial Board of ACM Computing Surveys and Encyclopedia of Database Technology and Applications (Idea Group). I was a member and chair the Computer and Information Science Grant Selection Committee of the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (1991-1994).","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0002-8126-1717/biography"},"researcher-urls":{"last-modified-date":{"value":1494597895200},"researcher-url":[{"created-date":{"value":1451966637332},"last-modified-date":{"value":1494597895200},"source":{"source-orcid":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8126-1717","path":"0000-0002-8126-1717","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"M.
