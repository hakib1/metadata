He worked as a research associate in Chemistry & Chemical Engineering Research Center of Iran (CCERCI) for 16 years. During his tenure at (CCERCI) he published more than 15 scientific articles in peer reviewed journals. Furthermore, he initiated and completed more 20 industrial and pharmaceutical projects. While he was at Trent University, he worked on the characterization of titanium dioxide nanoparticles. The results of his studies led to publication of three different peer reviewed articles. In 2012, he joined the Environmental Engineering Department of the University of Alberta as a postdoctoral researcher, where he embarked on a different path than nanoparticles. His main focus in Alberta has been on the remediation of oil sands process-affected water (OSPW) using a fresh approach based on advanced oxidation processes. His tenure in Alberta resulted in three peer reviewed articles.","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0001-5045-720X/biography"},"researcher-urls":{"last-modified-date":null,"researcher-url":[],"path":"/0000-0001-5045-720X/researcher-urls"},"emails":{"last-modified-date":null,"email":[],"path":"/0000-0001-5045-720X/email"},"addresses":{"last-modified-date":null,"address":[],"path":"/0000-0001-5045-720X/address"},"keywords":{"last-modified-date":{"value":1376362059659},"keyword":[{"created-date":{"value":1376362059659},"last-modified-date":{"value":1376362059659},"source":{"source-orcid":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5045-720X","path":"0000-0001-5045-720X","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"Kambiz Khosravi"}},"content":"Advanced oxidation, nanoparticles, analytical chamistry","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0001-5045-720X/keywords/26884","put-code":26884,"display-index":0}],"path":"/0000-0001-5045-720X/keywords"},"external-identifiers":{"last-modified-date":null,"external-identifier":[],"path":"/0000-0001-5045-720X/external-identifiers"},"path":"/0000-0001-5045-720X/person"}
