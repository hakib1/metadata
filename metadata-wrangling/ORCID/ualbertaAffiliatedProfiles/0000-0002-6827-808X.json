Her research interests concern the role of education policy and schooling practices in the medicalization of childhood and the improvement of responses to children who are difficult to teach.\n\nDr Graham completed her doctoral study, titled “Schooling Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorders: educational systems of formation and the ‘disorderly’ school child” at Queensland University of Technology in 2007. Of particular interest was how schooling practices and discourses may be contributing to the increased diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).\n\nSince graduating with the 2007 Faculty of Education Outstanding Thesis Award and the 2008 Australian Association of Research (AARE) Excellence in Doctoral Research Award, Linda has been awarded 4 successive research fellowships.\n\nThese highly competitive awards have included a postdoctoral fellowship at The University of Sydney (2007-2008), a Macquarie University Research Fellowship (The political economy of special educational needs: international trends and policy developments, 2009-2011), an Australian Research Council (ARC) Discovery Research Fellowship (A critical analysis of the increase in diagnosis of special educational needs in NSW government schools, 2010-2012), and most recently, a QUT Vice Chancellor’s Research Fellowship (Destination elsewhere: a longitudinal study of pathways into separate special educational settings for students with disruptive behaviour, 2013-2015).\n\nIn 2011, she was awarded a second ARC Discovery project grant (Tracking the experiences of students enrolled in special schools for challenging behaviour and their reintegration to mainstream) with Dr Penny Van Bergen & Dr Naomi Sweller (Macquarie University); one of only 19 successful proposals across Division 13: Education.\n\nShe has also partnered with international collaborators on a comparative project funded by the Social Sciences & Humanities Council of Canada with Professor Markku Jahnukainen, University of Alberta & University of Helsinki (Analysing the current state and change of special education in New South Wales, Finland and Alberta) and is partner investigator on a 2012-2013 Leverhulme International Network grant with Professor Sheila Riddell from the University of Edinburgh (Special Education & Policy Change: A study of six jurisdictions).\n\nIn the same year, Linda was named Macquarie University Early Career Researcher of the Year, and received both the Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia (ASSA) Paul Bourke Award and the Australian Association for Research in Education (AARE) Early Career Research Award. Linda is currently leading a prospective longitudinal study tracking the school liking, learning, language and behaviour of prep children through to end grade 2, which is funded by the Financial Markets Foundation for Children (Whose behaviour is and is not supported in the early years of school, why and with what effects?) with Dr Kathy Cologon (Institute of Early Childhood, Macquarie University) and A/Prof Sue Walker (School of Early Childhood, QUT).\n\nShe has appeared in numerous print, radio and television media and is a strong advocate that inclusive education is a foundation platform for broader social inclusion and the development of an inclusive democracy.","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0002-6827-808X/biography"},"researcher-urls":{"last-modified-date":{"value":1449460192995},"researcher-url":[{"created-date":{"value":1447732243179},"last-modified-date":{"value":1447732243189},"source":{"source-orcid":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6827-808X","path":"0000-0002-6827-808X","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"Linda
