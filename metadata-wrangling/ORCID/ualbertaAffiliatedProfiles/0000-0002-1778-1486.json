He had worked in the oil industry for 20+ years before entering academia. While working in the industry, James developed his expertise in these areas: formation evaluation, enhanced oil recovery, reservoir simulation and numerical modeling, heavy oil recovery, and reservoir management. Now he is actively working on EOR and shale research.\nHe holds a Ph.D. degree from University of Alberta. He has (co)authored over 160 papers, and holds 4 US patents and 3 provisional US patents. He has published two books: (1) Chemical Enhanced Oil Recovery, (2) EOR Field Case Studies.\nHe received several professional awards including two SPE Regional Technical Awards (Southwestern US region) (2013 and 2015), TTU Whitacre Engineering Excellent Research Award (2015), Most Influential Faculty Member (2015), the Fulbright Specialist Grant administrated by FSB, UD ECA and CIES to help PetroVietnam University to establish their petroleum program in 2013, the Outstanding Technical Editor Award (2005) and the Outstanding Associate Editor Award (2008) for SPEREE, and the Best Paper Award in JCPT (1997). He was an associate editor (2005-2009) for SPEREE and an associate editor for the Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering (2008-2011). He is also a member of the SPE “A Peer Apart” group. Each member in this group reviewed more than 100 SPE papers. He also served the SPE Kuwait section as the secretary (1998-1999).","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0002-1778-1486/biography"},"researcher-urls":{"last-modified-date":null,"researcher-url":[],"path":"/0000-0002-1778-1486/researcher-urls"},"emails":{"last-modified-date":null,"email":[],"path":"/0000-0002-1778-1486/email"},"addresses":{"last-modified-date":{"value":1465226976952},"address":[{"created-date":{"value":1453659052545},"last-modified-date":{"value":1465226976952},"source":{"source-orcid":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1778-1486","path":"0000-0002-1778-1486","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"James Sheng"}},"country":{"value":"US"},"visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0002-1778-1486/address/89697","put-code":89697,"display-index":0}],"path":"/0000-0002-1778-1486/address"},"keywords":{"last-modified-date":{"value":1476919386942},"keyword":[{"created-date":{"value":1405277352366},"last-modified-date":{"value":1476919386942},"source":{"source-orcid":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1778-1486","path":"0000-0002-1778-1486","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"James Sheng"}},"content":"Reservoir engineering, EOR, Shale, Reservoir simulation, pressure transient analysis","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0002-1778-1486/keywords/161194","put-code":161194,"display-index":1}],"path":"/0000-0002-1778-1486/keywords"},"external-identifiers":{"last-modified-date":{"value":1477022283708},"external-identifier":[{"created-date":{"value":1476901439486},"last-modified-date":{"value":1477022283708},"source":{"source-orcid":null,"source-client-id":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/client/0000-0002-5982-8983","path":"0000-0002-5982-8983","host":"orcid.org"},"source-name":{"value":"Scopus to ORCID"}},"external-id-type":"Scopus Author ID","external-id-value":"56663825600","external-id-url":{"value":"http://www.scopus.com/inward/authorDetails.url?authorID=56663825600&partnerID=MN8TOARS"},"external-id-relationship":"SELF","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0002-1778-1486/external-identifiers/567062","put-code":567062,"display-index":1},{"created-date":{"value":1477022283680},"last-modified-date":{"value":1477022283680},"source":{"source-orcid":null,"source-client-id":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/client/0000-0003-1377-5676","path":"0000-0003-1377-5676","host":"orcid.org"},"source-name":{"value":"ResearcherID"}},"external-id-type":"ResearcherID","external-id-value":"P-3295-2016","external-id-url":{"value":"http://www.researcherid.com/rid/P-3295-2016"},"external-id-relationship":"SELF","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0002-1778-1486/external-identifiers/568998","put-code":568998,"display-index":0}],"path":"/0000-0002-1778-1486/external-identifiers"},"path":"/0000-0002-1778-1486/person"}
