MG’s research is in Regenerative Medicine, with special interests in biomaterials enhanced cell-based regeneration. She was recruited to LiU to jump-start regenerative medicine there. The focus of her research is biomaterials-enabled regeneration, working mainly with collagen-based biomimetic materials. She has successfully led the first-in-human translation into clinic of biosynthetic corneal implants that stimulated regeneration in an organ that normally does not regenerate, in a clinical trial of 10 patients. MG's biosynthetic materials have also been successfully tested in collaboration with other researchers for use in cardiovascular, skin and cartilage regeneration in animal models to date, in preparation for clinical translation. Her work has been published in top peer-reviewed journals, as well as profiled by the media, and has earned her a number of awards. MG has worked extensively with industry, and led the EU ERAnet Nanomedicine project I-CARE (co-funded by VR and Vinnova), and is PI on several group grants funded by VR and AFA Försäkring.","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0003-1222-6720/biography"},"researcher-urls":{"last-modified-date":{"value":1452068791403},"researcher-url":[{"created-date":{"value":1452068791403},"last-modified-date":{"value":1452068791403},"source":{"source-orcid":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1222-6720","path":"0000-0003-1222-6720","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"May Griffith"}},"url-name":null,"url":{"value":"http://www.hu.liu.se/igen/griffith-may?l=en&sc=true"},"visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0003-1222-6720/researcher-urls/603667","put-code":603667,"display-index":0}],"path":"/0000-0003-1222-6720/researcher-urls"},"emails":{"last-modified-date":null,"email":[],"path":"/0000-0003-1222-6720/email"},"addresses":{"last-modified-date":null,"address":[],"path":"/0000-0003-1222-6720/address"},"keywords":{"last-modified-date":{"value":1378134535932},"keyword":[{"created-date":{"value":1378134535932},"last-modified-date":{"value":1378134535932},"source":{"source-orcid":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1222-6720","path":"0000-0003-1222-6720","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"May Griffith"}},"content":"regenerative medicine, biomaterials, stem cells, tissue engineering, cornea, cardiac","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0003-1222-6720/keywords/28209","put-code":28209,"display-index":0}],"path":"/0000-0003-1222-6720/keywords"},"external-identifiers":{"last-modified-date":{"value":1452068791399},"external-identifier":[{"created-date":{"value":1378134535932},"last-modified-date":{"value":1378134535932},"source":{"source-orcid":null,"source-client-id":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/client/0000-0002-5982-8983","path":"0000-0002-5982-8983","host":"orcid.org"},"source-name":{"value":"Scopus to ORCID"}},"external-id-type":"Scopus Author ID","external-id-value":"7102075338","external-id-url":{"value":"http://www.scopus.com/inward/authorDetails.url?authorID=7102075338&partnerID=MN8TOARS"},"external-id-relationship":"SELF","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0003-1222-6720/external-identifiers/161327","put-code":161327,"display-index":0},{"created-date":{"value":1452068791399},"last-modified-date":{"value":1452068791399},"source":{"source-orcid":null,"source-client-id":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/client/APP-4DPEW6SVSNQHKC8G","path":"APP-4DPEW6SVSNQHKC8G","host":"orcid.org"},"source-name":{"value":"Loop"}},"external-id-type":"Loop profile","external-id-value":"172721","external-id-url":{"value":"http://loop.frontiersin.org/people/172721/overview?referrer=orcid_profile"},"external-id-relationship":"SELF","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0003-1222-6720/external-identifiers/396086","put-code":396086,"display-index":0}],"path":"/0000-0003-1222-6720/external-identifiers"},"path":"/0000-0003-1222-6720/person"}
