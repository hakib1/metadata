Tech. degree in Metallurgical Engineering in 2000 from the Indian Institute of Technology-Madras, India, where he was awarded the prestigious Governors Gold Medal while convocating for all-round excellence from his graduating class of engineers.  He received his M.S. (2002) and Ph.D. (2007) degrees in Electrical Engineering from the Pennsylvania State University and worked as a post-doctoral Research Associate from 2007-2009 at Penn State Universityâ€™s Materials Research Institute.  Dr. Shankar was an Eastman Kodak Research Fellow in 2003.  He joined the department of Electrical & Computer Engineering at the University of Alberta as an Assistant Professor in Aug 2009.  In 2010, he received the PetroCanada Young Innovator Award. He was cross-appointed to the NRC National Institute for Nanotechnology in 2012.  He obtained early tenure and promotion to the rank of Associate Professor in July 2013.  He is the author of over 60 refereed publications.  He is also listed as an inventor on five provisional patent applications. \n\nResearch Interests : The Shankar group's research is at the intersection of nanotechnology and organic electronics. We are interested in (i) the growth of ordered nanostructured organic and inorganic semiconductors (ii) the exploration and exploitation of unique properties at the nanoscale, and (iii) the construction of functional optoelectronic and biosensing devices incorporating nanostructured semiconductors as the active layer.","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0001-7347-3333/biography"},"researcher-urls":{"last-modified-date":null,"researcher-url":[],"path":"/0000-0001-7347-3333/researcher-urls"},"emails":{"last-modified-date":null,"email":[],"path":"/0000-0001-7347-3333/email"},"addresses":{"last-modified-date":{"value":1465226976952},"address":[{"created-date":{"value":1453658966885},"last-modified-date":{"value":1465226976952},"source":{"source-orcid":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7347-3333","path":"0000-0001-7347-3333","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"Karthik Shankar"}},"country":{"value":"CA"},"visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0001-7347-3333/address/75278","put-code":75278,"display-index":0}],"path":"/0000-0001-7347-3333/address"},"keywords":{"last-modified-date":null,"keyword":[],"path":"/0000-0001-7347-3333/keywords"},"external-identifiers":{"last-modified-date":{"value":1412012418112},"external-identifier":[{"created-date":{"value":1412012418112},"last-modified-date":{"value":1412012418112},"source":{"source-orcid":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7707-4137","path":"0000-0001-7707-4137","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"Clarivate Analytics"}},"external-id-type":"ResearcherID","external-id-value":"B-9455-2009","external-id-url":{"value":"http://www.researcherid.com/rid/B-9455-2009"},"external-id-relationship":"SELF","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0001-7347-3333/external-identifiers/119974","put-code":119974,"display-index":0}],"path":"/0000-0001-7347-3333/external-identifiers"},"path":"/0000-0001-7347-3333/person"}
