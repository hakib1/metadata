Formerly, I was a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Alberta's Department of Educational Policy Studies and Curriculum Coordinator at the Centre for Global Citizenship Education and Research there. I researched current trends in global citizenship education and support the work of the centre promoting initiatives for teachers and students in K-12 and higher education in promotion of critical approaches to global citizenship education. Previously I was a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Oulu in Finland. My main responsibility was to the large-scale comparative study Ethical Internationalism in Higher Education in Times of Global Crises (P. I. Vanessa Andreotti). It involved an extensive mixed-methods study of conceptualizations of internationalism in the view of policy texts, students, and faculty members in 28 universities in 10 countries in 5 continents. I also taught and supervised students in the Education and Globalisation graduate program. My PhD research at OISE/University of Toronto examined the overlooked tensions inherent to global citizenship education in multicultural contexts. I also worked in the initial teacher education program there, most recently as co-ordinator and instructor in the global citizenship and sustainable development cohort.","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0002-9967-8262/biography"},"researcher-urls":{"last-modified-date":{"value":1392740006321},"researcher-url":[{"created-date":{"value":1392740006321},"last-modified-date":{"value":1392740006321},"source":{"source-orcid":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9967-8262","path":"0000-0002-9967-8262","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"Karen Pashby"}},"url-name":"academia webpage","url":{"value":"https://utoronto.academia.edu/KarenPashby"},"visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0002-9967-8262/researcher-urls/232415","put-code":232415,"display-index":0}],"path":"/0000-0002-9967-8262/researcher-urls"},"emails":{"last-modified-date":null,"email":[],"path":"/0000-0002-9967-8262/email"},"addresses":{"last-modified-date":null,"address":[],"path":"/0000-0002-9967-8262/address"},"keywords":{"last-modified-date":{"value":1392740006306},"keyword":[{"created-date":{"value":1392740006306},"last-modified-date":{"value":1392740006306},"source":{"source-orcid":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9967-8262","path":"0000-0002-9967-8262","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"Karen Pashby"}},"content":"global citizenship education, ethical internationalism, critical multiculturalism, postcolonial theory","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0002-9967-8262/keywords/72189","put-code":72189,"display-index":0}],"path":"/0000-0002-9967-8262/keywords"},"external-identifiers":{"last-modified-date":null,"external-identifier":[],"path":"/0000-0002-9967-8262/external-identifiers"},"path":"/0000-0002-9967-8262/person"}
