For BioInformatics, he developed a system named IMAS that was used at the US Center for Disease Control to analyse the sequence of the Orientia Tsutsgamushi microbe. In Visual Analytics, he has been co-developing the CZSaw text analytics system in collaboration with Rob Woodbury and John Dill. The CZSaw team won two awards in the VAST Challenge 2010 for this work on CZSaw. The CZSaw work has been funded by an NSERC Discovery grant, by a grant from Boeing, and by an NSERC CRD grant. Shaw has a parallel effort with Diane Gromala in the development of the Chronic Pain Research Lab, where they are developing new technologies to address Chronic Pain. This has led to significant collaborations with the medical research community, and funding from CIHR to develop patient decision aids and other media technologies for the medical community. Shaw is the co-founder of the Chronic Pain Research Institute, which brings together researchers, clinicians and patients to develop new technologies for chronic pain, in addition to providing a home for Health Informatics researchers in the emerging Surrey Health Innovation Boulevard. Shaw is a Principal Network Investigator of the GRAND NCE. \r\nShaw received his PhD in Computing Science from the University of Alberta in 1997, and his BMath (Hons CoOp) in Computer Science from the University of Waterloo in 1986","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0002-6940-7971/biography"},"researcher-urls":{"last-modified-date":{"value":1405923242914},"researcher-url":[{"created-date":{"value":1405923242914},"last-modified-date":{"value":1405923242914},"source":{"source-orcid":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6940-7971","path":"0000-0002-6940-7971","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"Christopher D Shaw"}},"url-name":"SFU Website","url":{"value":"http://www.sfu.ca/~shaw/"},"visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0002-6940-7971/researcher-urls/310001","put-code":310001,"display-index":0}],"path":"/0000-0002-6940-7971/researcher-urls"},"emails":{"last-modified-date":null,"email":[],"path":"/0000-0002-6940-7971/email"},"addresses":{"last-modified-date":{"value":1465226976952},"address":[{"created-date":{"value":1453660548430},"last-modified-date":{"value":1465226976952},"source":{"source-orcid":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6940-7971","path":"0000-0002-6940-7971","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"Christopher D Shaw"}},"country":{"value":"CA"},"visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0002-6940-7971/address/370726","put-code":370726,"display-index":0}],"path":"/0000-0002-6940-7971/address"},"keywords":{"last-modified-date":{"value":1384566194409},"keyword":[{"created-date":{"value":1384566194409},"last-modified-date":{"value":1384566194409},"source":{"source-orcid":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6940-7971","path":"0000-0002-6940-7971","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"Christopher D Shaw"}},"content":"Visual Analytics, Bioinformatics visualization, Virtual Environments, Chronic Pain","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0002-6940-7971/keywords/39305","put-code":39305,"display-index":0}],"path":"/0000-0002-6940-7971/keywords"},"external-identifiers":{"last-modified-date":null,"external-identifier":[],"path":"/0000-0002-6940-7971/external-identifiers"},"path":"/0000-0002-6940-7971/person"}
