Korean Physical Activity and Health Study was a three year study which followed male high school studentsâ€™ (about 400 students) physical activity levels, fitness, fatness, metabolic parameters and intima media thickness (IMT).  Another epidemiological study was performed (Study 1 with 15000 participants, and study 2 with 60000 participants) which investigated the effects of high school fitness and fatness levels on obesity and metabolic syndrome risk factors during adulthood (22 year follow up).","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0001-7978-4271/biography"},"researcher-urls":{"last-modified-date":null,"researcher-url":[],"path":"/0000-0001-7978-4271/researcher-urls"},"emails":{"last-modified-date":null,"email":[],"path":"/0000-0001-7978-4271/email"},"addresses":{"last-modified-date":{"value":1465226976952},"address":[{"created-date":{"value":1453660735215},"last-modified-date":{"value":1465226976952},"source":{"source-orcid":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7978-4271","path":"0000-0001-7978-4271","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"Justin Jeon"}},"country":{"value":"KR"},"visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0001-7978-4271/address/402975","put-code":402975,"display-index":0}],"path":"/0000-0001-7978-4271/address"},"keywords":{"last-modified-date":{"value":1442447127931},"keyword":[{"created-date":{"value":1442447127931},"last-modified-date":{"value":1442447127931},"source":{"source-orcid":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7978-4271","path":"0000-0001-7978-4271","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"Justin Jeon"}},"content":"Exercise, Obesity, Diabetes, Cancer","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0001-7978-4271/keywords/220236","put-code":220236,"display-index":0}],"path":"/0000-0001-7978-4271/keywords"},"external-identifiers":{"last-modified-date":null,"external-identifier":[],"path":"/0000-0001-7978-4271/external-identifiers"},"path":"/0000-0001-7978-4271/person"}
