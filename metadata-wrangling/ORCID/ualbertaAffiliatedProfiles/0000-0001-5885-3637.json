The research activities which are carried out by Prof. Santos essentially can be grouped in two major areas: process monitoring and petroleum engineering. He has educated 5 PhDs and 17 MSc in Chemical Engineering and managed a number of R&D projects focused on petroleum issues and funded by industrial partners (Petrobras and Braskem) or governmental agencies (CNPq, Capes, FINEP). Also, he has experience in Joint International Projects involving different oil companies (Statoil, BP, TOTAL, Canadian Natural Resources, Petrobras) and universities (NTNU/Norway, Université de Pau/France, University of Alberta and UFPR/Brazil) focused on asphaltenes and emulsion stability. These developments enabled the filing of three patents in the last 10 years.","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0001-5885-3637/biography"},"researcher-urls":{"last-modified-date":null,"researcher-url":[],"path":"/0000-0001-5885-3637/researcher-urls"},"emails":{"last-modified-date":{"value":1494421146670},"email":[{"created-date":{"value":1494417967137},"last-modified-date":{"value":1494421146670},"source":{"source-orcid":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5885-3637","path":"0000-0001-5885-3637","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"Alexandre Santos"}},"email":"alexfsantos@ufpr.br","path":null,"visibility":"PUBLIC","verified":true,"primary":true,"put-code":null}],"path":"/0000-0001-5885-3637/email"},"addresses":{"last-modified-date":null,"address":[],"path":"/0000-0001-5885-3637/address"},"keywords":{"last-modified-date":null,"keyword":[],"path":"/0000-0001-5885-3637/keywords"},"external-identifiers":{"last-modified-date":{"value":1494418242059},"external-identifier":[{"created-date":{"value":1494418154824},"last-modified-date":{"value":1494418242059},"source":{"source-orcid":null,"source-client-id":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/client/0000-0003-1377-5676","path":"0000-0003-1377-5676","host":"orcid.org"},"source-name":{"value":"ResearcherID"}},"external-id-type":"ResearcherID","external-id-value":"N-6714-2016","external-id-url":{"value":"http://www.researcherid.com/rid/N-6714-2016"},"external-id-relationship":"SELF","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0001-5885-3637/external-identifiers/702115","put-code":702115,"display-index":1}],"path":"/0000-0001-5885-3637/external-identifiers"},"path":"/0000-0001-5885-3637/person"}
