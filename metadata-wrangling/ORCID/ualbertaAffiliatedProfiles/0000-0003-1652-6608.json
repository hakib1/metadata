In 1978, Dr. Fritzler joined the University of Calgary as an Arthritis Society Scientist.  He is currently Professor of Medicine at the University of Calgary where his clinical activity is devoted to clinical immunology and directing autoantibody testing through the Mitogen Advanced Diagnostics Laboratory. \r\n\r\nDr. Fritzlerâ€™s research interests are the identification of novel autoantibodies and biomarkers for autoimmune diseases and the development of innovative diagnostic technologies. His current research is focused on autoantibodies to GW bodies, endosomes, extracellular exosomes and ribosomal P proteins. He has published more than 350 papers and book chapters and has been a contributor to many national and international organizations. He was President of the Western Section of the American Rheumatism Association and the Canadian Society of Clinical Investigation.
