Arya received BSc. in Chemistry in 2002, MSc. in Organic Chemistry in 2004 and Ph.D. in Chemistry-Biosensor in 2008 from the University of Delhi, Delhi, India. I am currently a Marie Curie Fellow at University of Bath and working on development of biosensor device for detection of cancer markers using electrochemical Elisa. Earlier handled many electrochemical biosensor related projects as project leader or team member, while working at institute of microelectronics, A*star, Singapore (Scientist), University of South Florida, Tampa, Florida, USA (Post doc) and National Institute of Nanotechnology and university of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada (Post doc). Worked mainly involved microfabrication based sensor development, surface chemistry involving monolayers, conducting polymers, nanomaterials, nanocomposites and their modification for biosensor application, electrochemical assay development, bioanalyte testing in buffer and serum protocol development, writing papers and grants, handling various optical and electrochemical instruments involved in biosensor fabrication and testing. I blend everywhere with adaptive nature and thinkers attitude, and enjoy working individually and in team. For organization that values hard-working, proactive and loyal individuals, I aspire to contribute in their growth using my skills and training","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0002-3425-4231/biography"},"researcher-urls":{"last-modified-date":null,"researcher-url":[],"path":"/0000-0002-3425-4231/researcher-urls"},"emails":{"last-modified-date":null,"email":[],"path":"/0000-0002-3425-4231/email"},"addresses":{"last-modified-date":null,"address":[],"path":"/0000-0002-3425-4231/address"},"keywords":{"last-modified-date":{"value":1362701041479},"keyword":[{"created-date":{"value":1362701041479},"last-modified-date":{"value":1362701041479},"source":{"source-orcid":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3425-4231","path":"0000-0002-3425-4231","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"Sunil Arya"}},"content":"Biosensor, self-assembled monolayer","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0002-3425-4231/keywords/4966","put-code":4966,"display-index":0}],"path":"/0000-0002-3425-4231/keywords"},"external-identifiers":{"last-modified-date":{"value":1362701041478},"external-identifier":[{"created-date":{"value":1362701041478},"last-modified-date":{"value":1362701041478},"source":{"source-orcid":null,"source-client-id":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/client/0000-0002-5982-8983","path":"0000-0002-5982-8983","host":"orcid.org"},"source-name":{"value":"Scopus to ORCID"}},"external-id-type":"Scopus Author ID","external-id-value":"7201802240","external-id-url":{"value":"http://www.scopus.com/inward/authorDetails.url?authorID=7201802240&partnerID=MN8TOARS"},"external-id-relationship":"SELF","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0002-3425-4231/external-identifiers/134768","put-code":134768,"display-index":0}],"path":"/0000-0002-3425-4231/external-identifiers"},"path":"/0000-0002-3425-4231/person"}
