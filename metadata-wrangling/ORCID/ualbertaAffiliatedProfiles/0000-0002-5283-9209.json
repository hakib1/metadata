I run workshops in student engagement, classroom assessment, course (re)design, and the integration of technology and social media in teaching. I also teach part-time in the Department of English at MacEwan University.\n\nI have over twenty years of experience teaching courses in postcolonial literatures and literary theory, with a strong emphasis on the literatures of Canada. My book Sanctioned Ignorance: the politics of knowledge production and the teaching of the literatures of Canada was published by the University of Alberta Press in 2013 and won the 2013 Gabrielle Roy Prize (English section) which each year honors the best work of Canadian Literary Criticism in English.\n\nBefore joining MacEwan in 2011, I was Director of the University of Vermont's Canadian Studies Program and an Assistant Professor in the Department of English. Between 1996 and 2009, I also helped to run Northwest Passages, a Canadian literature online bookstore and information resource I co-founded in 1996.","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0002-5283-9209/biography"},"researcher-urls":{"last-modified-date":{"value":1496026519652},"researcher-url":[{"created-date":{"value":1496026519652},"last-modified-date":{"value":1496026519652},"source":{"source-orcid":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5283-9209","path":"0000-0002-5283-9209","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"Paul Martin"}},"url-name":"Paul Martin","url":{"value":"http://paulwmartin.ca"},"visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0002-5283-9209/researcher-urls/1141933","put-code":1141933,"display-index":1}],"path":"/0000-0002-5283-9209/researcher-urls"},"emails":{"last-modified-date":null,"email":[],"path":"/0000-0002-5283-9209/email"},"addresses":{"last-modified-date":{"value":1496026532843},"address":[{"created-date":{"value":1496026532843},"last-modified-date":{"value":1496026532843},"source":{"source-orcid":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5283-9209","path":"0000-0002-5283-9209","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"Paul Martin"}},"country":{"value":"CA"},"visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0002-5283-9209/address/712527","put-code":712527,"display-index":1}],"path":"/0000-0002-5283-9209/address"},"keywords":{"last-modified-date":null,"keyword":[],"path":"/0000-0002-5283-9209/keywords"},"external-identifiers":{"last-modified-date":null,"external-identifier":[],"path":"/0000-0002-5283-9209/external-identifiers"},"path":"/0000-0002-5283-9209/person"}
