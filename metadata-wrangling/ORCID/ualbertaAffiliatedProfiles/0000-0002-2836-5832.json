My research interests focus on understanding how aquatic animals cope with environmental stress such as hypoxia (low PO2), hypercapnia (high PCO2), temperature, salinity, and high environmental ammonia (HEA).  Such stressors require adaptive physiological mechanisms to prevent impairment of biological functions.  I am particularly interested in organisms living in extreme environments because, in general they have developed unique adaptations in order to survive and thrive. My research program uses a multidisciplinary approach, whereby I employ techniques in whole-animal physiology, biochemistry, bioinformatics and molecular biology to examine the relationships between environment and evolutionary adaptation. My PhD project focuses on pH homeostasis, ionoregulation, and respiratory adaptations of the Pacific hagfish (Epataretus stoutii). Hagfish share an ionic profile similar to marine invertebrates and represent the evolutionary transition between the invertebrates and vertebrates. They are also scavengers that feed on decaying carrion (e.g. whale fall) which expose the organism to an array of environmental stressors including hypoxia, high PCO2 and HEA.  Hagfish are extremely tolerant of these perturbations and my PhD aims to characterize the mechanisms by which hagfish are able to accomplish these feats.","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0002-2836-5832/biography"},"researcher-urls":{"last-modified-date":null,"researcher-url":[],"path":"/0000-0002-2836-5832/researcher-urls"},"emails":{"last-modified-date":null,"email":[],"path":"/0000-0002-2836-5832/email"},"addresses":{"last-modified-date":null,"address":[],"path":"/0000-0002-2836-5832/address"},"keywords":{"last-modified-date":null,"keyword":[],"path":"/0000-0002-2836-5832/keywords"},"external-identifiers":{"last-modified-date":{"value":1494974685158},"external-identifier":[{"created-date":{"value":1461181097436},"last-modified-date":{"value":1494974685158},"source":{"source-orcid":null,"source-client-id":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/client/0000-0002-5982-8983","path":"0000-0002-5982-8983","host":"orcid.org"},"source-name":{"value":"Scopus to ORCID"}},"external-id-type":"Scopus Author ID","external-id-value":"55960851200","external-id-url":{"value":"http://www.scopus.com/inward/authorDetails.url?authorID=55960851200&partnerID=MN8TOARS"},"external-id-relationship":"SELF","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0002-2836-5832/external-identifiers/465514","put-code":465514,"display-index":2},{"created-date":{"value":1494974632137},"last-modified-date":{"value":1494974685158},"source":{"source-orcid":null,"source-client-id":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/client/0000-0003-1377-5676","path":"0000-0003-1377-5676","host":"orcid.org"},"source-name":{"value":"ResearcherID"}},"external-id-type":"ResearcherID","external-id-value":"H-7592-2017","external-id-url":{"value":"http://www.researcherid.com/rid/H-7592-2017"},"external-id-relationship":"SELF","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0002-2836-5832/external-identifiers/707325","put-code":707325,"display-index":1}],"path":"/0000-0002-2836-5832/external-identifiers"},"path":"/0000-0002-2836-5832/person"}
