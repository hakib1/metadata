His initial model started off with a detailed retina coupled to saccadic and eye-blink motor systems resulting in a visual sensory-motor system that simultaneously handles change in the environment and due to the eye itself. This cognitive model will be improved to handle auditory, tactile and emotive senses, as well as more sophisticated degrees of motion.\n\nHowever, as additional capability taxes the current architecture, it will be refactored so that a single more flexible cognitive model remains. In other words, the ontology of the model changes over time. Thus the emphasis is less about what the current model is, and more about how to unify modeling. This is an epistemology, and David’s research spans the divide between ontology (ordinary science) and epistemology (ordinary philosophy) in a dynamic manner called the Emergic Approach.Emergic Approach Logo This is David’s secondary goal, and ultimately the greater contribution.\n\nWhen a single model is required for a domain spanning numerous fields and subfields, it requires “cutting” cognition into alternative and finer joints, as well as explicating such choices in as simple a manner as possible to cover a diverse group of academics with more focused interests. A WikiSilo is a specialized unifying tool developed by David, and is just one of many tools David uses to disseminate his research.","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0001-7251-8528/biography"},"researcher-urls":{"last-modified-date":{"value":1498139911919},"researcher-url":[{"created-date":{"value":1383846025201},"last-modified-date":{"value":1498139911919},"source":{"source-orcid":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7251-8528","path":"0000-0001-7251-8528","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"David Pierre Leibovitz"}},"url-name":null,"url":{"value":"http://dpleibovitz.upwize.com/"},"visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0001-7251-8528/researcher-urls/174487","put-code":174487,"display-index":1},{"created-date":{"value":1498139911917},"last-modified-date":{"value":1498139911917},"source":{"source-orcid":null,"source-client-id":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/client/0000-0001-6478-3604","path":"0000-0001-6478-3604","host":"orcid.org"},"source-name":{"value":"Elsevier - Mendeley"}},"url-name":"Mendeley profile","url":{"value":"https://www.mendeley.com/profiles/david-pierre-leibovitz/"},"visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0001-7251-8528/researcher-urls/1160822","put-code":1160822,"display-index":0}],"path":"/0000-0001-7251-8528/researcher-urls"},"emails":{"last-modified-date":null,"email":[],"path":"/0000-0001-7251-8528/email"},"addresses":{"last-modified-date":{"value":1465226976952},"address":[{"created-date":{"value":1453660599358},"last-modified-date":{"value":1465226976952},"source":{"source-orcid":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7251-8528","path":"0000-0001-7251-8528","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"David Pierre Leibovitz"}},"country":{"value":"CA"},"visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0001-7251-8528/address/379448","put-code":379448,"display-index":0}],"path":"/0000-0001-7251-8528/address"},"keywords":{"last-modified-date":{"value":1364480172580},"keyword":[{"created-date":{"value":1364480172580},"last-modified-date":{"value":1364480172580},"source":{"source-orcid":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7251-8528","path":"0000-0001-7251-8528","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"David Pierre Leibovitz"}},"content":"unified cognitive modeling","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0001-7251-8528/keywords/5612","put-code":5612,"display-index":0}],"path":"/0000-0001-7251-8528/keywords"},"external-identifiers":{"last-modified-date":null,"external-identifier":[],"path":"/0000-0001-7251-8528/external-identifiers"},"path":"/0000-0001-7251-8528/person"}
