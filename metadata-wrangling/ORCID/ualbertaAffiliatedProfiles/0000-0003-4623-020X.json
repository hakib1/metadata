This Network supports a national research data management service and infrastructure to assist researchers and other stakeholders in research through (i) a library-based network of expertise on research data management and (ii) national platforms for planning, preserving, and discovering research data. As the inaugural director of Portage, Chuck is responsible for defining the scope and governance of the network, seeking resources for it, and overseeing its initial stages of development. Prior to becoming the Portage Network Director, he managed data services in University of Alberta Libraries for 23 years and worked on numerous regional, national and international initiatives to increase access to data for teaching and research. He was involved in Canadian consultations on data preservation and access in 2000-2002 and 2004-2005 as well as the Global Research Data Infrastructure 2020 workshop in 2011 and the OECD Global Science Forums on Data and Research Infrastructure for the Social Sciences in 2010-2011 and Ethics and Big Data in 2014-2015. Chuck has served as the Academic Director of the Alberta Research Data Centre since 2001 and was the lead investigator for a data centre in the Canadian International Polar Year (IPY) Data Assembly Centres Network. He currently serves on the Steering Committee of Research Data Canada; is a Board member of the Consortia Advancing Standards in Research Administrative Information; and has been engaged in the Research Data Canada Federated Pilot projects investigating preservation and discovery infrastructure solutions.","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0003-4623-020X/biography"},"researcher-urls":{"last-modified-date":null,"researcher-url":[],"path":"/0000-0003-4623-020X/researcher-urls"},"emails":{"last-modified-date":null,"email":[],"path":"/0000-0003-4623-020X/email"},"addresses":{"last-modified-date":{"value":1465226976952},"address":[{"created-date":{"value":1453660106254},"last-modified-date":{"value":1465226976952},"source":{"source-orcid":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4623-020X","path":"0000-0003-4623-020X","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"Charles Humphrey"}},"country":{"value":"CA"},"visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0003-4623-020X/address/285011","put-code":285011,"display-index":0}],"path":"/0000-0003-4623-020X/address"},"keywords":{"last-modified-date":{"value":1418346983110},"keyword":[{"created-date":{"value":1418346936064},"last-modified-date":{"value":1418346936064},"source":{"source-orcid":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4623-020X","path":"0000-0003-4623-020X","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"Charles Humphrey"}},"content":"Data Curator","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0003-4623-020X/keywords/290775","put-code":290775,"display-index":0},{"created-date":{"value":1418346983086},"last-modified-date":{"value":1418346983086},"source":{"source-orcid":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4623-020X","path":"0000-0003-4623-020X","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"Charles Humphrey"}},"content":"Research Data Management Services","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0003-4623-020X/keywords/290776","put-code":290776,"display-index":0},{"created-date":{"value":1418346983090},"last-modified-date":{"value":1418346983090},"source":{"source-orcid":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4623-020X","path":"0000-0003-4623-020X","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"Charles Humphrey"}},"content":"Data Management Plans","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0003-4623-020X/keywords/290777","put-code":290777,"display-index":0},{"created-date":{"value":1418346983100},"last-modified-date":{"value":1418346983100},"source":{"source-orcid":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4623-020X","path":"0000-0003-4623-020X","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"Charles Humphrey"}},"content":"Data Librarian","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0003-4623-020X/keywords/290778","put-code":290778,"display-index":0},{"created-date":{"value":1418346983110},"last-modified-date":{"value":1418346983110},"source":{"source-orcid":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4623-020X","path":"0000-0003-4623-020X","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"Charles Humphrey"}},"content":"Preserving Research Data","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0003-4623-020X/keywords/290779","put-code":290779,"display-index":0}],"path":"/0000-0003-4623-020X/keywords"},"external-identifiers":{"last-modified-date":null,"external-identifier":[],"path":"/0000-0003-4623-020X/external-identifiers"},"path":"/0000-0003-4623-020X/person"}
