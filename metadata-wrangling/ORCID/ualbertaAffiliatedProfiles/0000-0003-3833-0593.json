Marie, ON. While at AlgomaU I started as a volunteer research assistant in Dr. Keough's lab, conducted my honours thesis under Dr. Brodbeck's supervision, and was awarded an NSERC USRA to work in Dr. Bloomfield's lab. I started at the University of Alberta in September, 2013 as a Masterâ€™s student with Dr. Christopher Sturdy. As a graduate student in the Songbird Neuroethology Laboratory, I am primarily interested in chickadees' vocal and movement responses to varying levels of predator threat and providing further evidence for referential communication in songbirds. I am currently funded by an NSERC CGS-M.","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0003-3833-0593/biography"},"researcher-urls":{"last-modified-date":null,"researcher-url":[],"path":"/0000-0003-3833-0593/researcher-urls"},"emails":{"last-modified-date":null,"email":[],"path":"/0000-0003-3833-0593/email"},"addresses":{"last-modified-date":null,"address":[],"path":"/0000-0003-3833-0593/address"},"keywords":{"last-modified-date":null,"keyword":[],"path":"/0000-0003-3833-0593/keywords"},"external-identifiers":{"last-modified-date":null,"external-identifier":[],"path":"/0000-0003-3833-0593/external-identifiers"},"path":"/0000-0003-3833-0593/person"}
