She is also Adjunct Faculty (PT) at NCCC, SUNY, where she supports the Learning Advance Center (LAC) in topics such as mathematics, statistics and geology. Previous graduate teaching experience focused on remote sensing, planetary geology, astronomical instrumentation, space stations concepts and operations at APUS (2014-2017); remote sensing, GIS programming and customization, databases, and geospatial data integration for planetary and Earth science applications at the USC (2011-2014); geology and environmental sciences at the UH West (2010-2011).\n\nDr. Paganelli is a Cassini RADAR Science Team Associate Member (2006 – present) and a Planetary Data System Roadmap Study Team (RST) Member  (2016-present).\n\nDr. Paganelli held an Associate positions at JPL /UCLA (2009-2010) with research focus on Titan’s structure and surface properties characterization. She was a receiver of the NRC Fellowship Award (2004-2007) during which she was Research Associate at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and worked extensively with the Cassini RADAR Science Team to unravel Titan’s surface using Cassini’s SAR, radiometry, and VIMS data. Dr. Paganelli has previously worked as Research Associate with the Canada Center for Remote Sensing and the Geological Survey of Canada (2002-2004) with focus on RADAR and multispectral imaging and analysis for applications in minerals exploration and environmental assessments.\n\nDr. Paganelli earned her PhD in Remote Sensing applied to mineral exploration from the Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada (2002). She holds an MSc in Geological Survey from the Division of Geological Survey, International Institute for Aerospace Survey and Earth Sciences, Enschede, The Netherlands (1996), and a BSc in Geology from the Department of Earth Sciences, University of Turin, Italy (1993).","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0001-9403-0048/biography"},"researcher-urls":{"last-modified-date":{"value":1496670728136},"researcher-url":[{"created-date":{"value":1485461916665},"last-modified-date":{"value":1496670728136},"source":{"source-orcid":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9403-0048","path":"0000-0001-9403-0048","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"Flora Paganelli"}},"url-name":"Gloogle Scholar","url":{"value":"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=g4o7Jn4AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate"},"visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0001-9403-0048/researcher-urls/1024137","put-code":1024137,"display-index":1}],"path":"/0000-0001-9403-0048/researcher-urls"},"emails":{"last-modified-date":null,"email":[],"path":"/0000-0001-9403-0048/email"},"addresses":{"last-modified-date":{"value":1485462898384},"address":[{"created-date":{"value":1485462898384},"last-modified-date":{"value":1485462898384},"source":{"source-orcid":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9403-0048","path":"0000-0001-9403-0048","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"Flora Paganelli"}},"country":{"value":"US"},"visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0001-9403-0048/address/619288","put-code":619288,"display-index":1}],"path":"/0000-0001-9403-0048/address"},"keywords":{"last-modified-date":{"value":1485462857461},"keyword":[{"created-date":{"value":1485462857461},"last-modified-date":{"value":1485462857461},"source":{"source-orcid":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9403-0048","path":"0000-0001-9403-0048","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"Flora Paganelli"}},"content":"Planetary Science, Remote Sensing, RADAR, Geology, Instruments","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0001-9403-0048/keywords/621885","put-code":621885,"display-index":1}],"path":"/0000-0001-9403-0048/keywords"},"external-identifiers":{"last-modified-date":null,"external-identifier":[],"path":"/0000-0001-9403-0048/external-identifiers"},"path":"/0000-0001-9403-0048/person"}
