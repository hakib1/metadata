I have a passion for Clinical work & Scientific Research, and  looking for an opportunity to continue to serve as a Clinical Pharmacist, Pharmacologist or Clinical Scientist for a reputable organization. In addition, i gained experience for more than 5 years in Biomedical Equipment from SINOMEDICA CO.LTD (Nanjing) as i had part-time job while i was pursuing my studies.\n\nI am a strongly rigorous and analytical person with a proven record of research and clinical skills.
