We combine experimental petrology with detailed geochemical and mineralogical analyses of synthetic and natural samples to test hypotheses regarding the processes involved in the genesis of magmatic-hydrothermal ore deposits (metal partition and mass transfer, sulfide saturation, solubility, phase equilibria, crystal growth). \r\n\r\nAs known metallic resources are used, new sources of raw materials (needed to ensure sustainable development) become increasingly harder to find. The results of the work in my research team are used to refine the exploration strategies needed to find such resources.
