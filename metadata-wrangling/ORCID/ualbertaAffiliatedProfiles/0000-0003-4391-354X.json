He is also member of the Editorial Board of Geoderma (Elsevier), Journal of Soils and Sediments (Springer), Heliyon (Elsevier), Soil (Copernicus Publications), Cogent Food & Agriculture (Taylor & Francis), and Journal of Chemistry (Hindawi).\nHe is member of the following scientific societies: International Humic Substances Society (IHSS), International Union of Soil Sciences (IUSS), European Geosciences Union (EGU), Italian Society of Soil Sciences (SISS), and Italian Society of Agricultural Chemistry (SICA). He is also Science Officer of the Soil System Sciences Division of the EGU, Web Officer of the IHSS, and Treasurer of the SISS.\nHe has been awarded by the European Geosciences Union (EGU) with the Outstanding Young Scientist Award of the Soil System Sciences Division for the year 2012.","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0003-4391-354X/biography"},"researcher-urls":{"last-modified-date":{"value":1488874760424},"researcher-url":[{"created-date":{"value":1462780134264},"last-modified-date":{"value":1488874760424},"source":{"source-orcid":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4391-354X","path":"0000-0003-4391-354X","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"Claudio Zaccone; C.
