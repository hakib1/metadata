He is a Senior Scientist at the Center for Molecular Medicine and Therapeutics (CMMT) in Vancouver, Canada; a genetic research center within UBC. He is also the Program Director of the Translational Laboratory in Genetic Medicine in Singapore, and was appointed in 2012 as the President of Global R&D and Chief Scientific Officer at Teva Pharmaceutical Industries.\nMichael was the top graduate in medicine (1975) from the University of Cape Town, where he also received his PhD in Genetics (1979). He completed a post-doctoral fellowship and further training in Internal Medicine and Genetics at Harvard Medical School. Michael is board-certified in both Internal Medicine and Clinical Genetics.  Author of over 840 peer-reviewed publications and invited submissions (h-index 105), Michael focuses his research primarily on genetic diseases, including predictive and personalized medicine, genetics of lipoprotein disorders and Huntingtons disease. Michael and his research group have identified 10 disease-causing genes which includes the identification of the major gene underlying high-density lipoprotein (HDL) in humans. This gene, known as ABCA1, has major implications for atherosclerosis and diabetes. Michael also identified the first mutations underlying Lipoprotein Lipase (LPL) Deficiency and developed gene therapy approaches to treat this condition, resulting in the first approval of gene therapy in the world in 2012 (Glybera). He is also co-leader of the Canadian Pharmacogenomics Network for Drug Safety project, a BC-led Genome Canada-funded, national strategy to prevent adverse drug reactions. He is the most cited author in the world for ABCA1 and Huntington Disease.\nMichael is the recipient of numerous prestigious honours and awards. His recent awards include an Honorary Doctor of Science by the University of Gottingen, and the Luminary award by the Personalized Medicine World Conference in recognition of his development of a predictive genetic test for Huntington disease and his work in identifying genes associated with rare disorders in 2014. In 2013, he was named one of 50 Canadians who changed the world in a book by Ken McGoogan. In July 2012, he was awarded the Diamond Jubilee Medal, on behalf of HRH Queen Elizabeth II, in recognition of his significant contributions and achievements. In May 2011, he received the Aubrey J. Tingle Prize, which is given to a clinician scientist whose work in health research is internationally recognized and has significant impact on advancing clinical or health services and policy research in BC and globally. In April 2011, he received the Margolese National Brain Disorder Prize, awarded to Canadians who have made outstanding contributions to the treatment, amelioration, or cure of brain diseases; the Killam Prize by the Canada Council of the Arts, in recognition of his outstanding career achievements. In March 2011, he was the recipient of the Genome BC Award for Scientific Excellence for his outstanding contributions to genetics and the development of British Columbiaâ€™s life sciences industry; and the Canada Gairdner Wightman award, recognizing him as a physician-scientist who has demonstrated outstanding leadership in medicine and medical science. \nIn December 2010, he was awarded the Order of Canada, which is the highest honour that Canada can give its citizens for exceptional achievement, merit or service. He also was awarded the Jacob Biely Prize which is UBC's premier research prize in 2010. In 2009, Michael was awarded the Order of British Columbia. This highest form of recognition by the Province is given to a select few who have served with the greatest distinction and benefited the people of the Province, Canada and the world. In June 2009, Michael was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Science by the University of Alberta. \nMichael is also the founder of three successful biotechnology companies- NeuroVir, Xenon Genetics, Inc., and Aspreva Pharmaceuticals, Inc. In 2006, Michael received 5 different Entrepreneurial Awards including the Career Achievement Award from the BC Innovation Council and he received the BC Biotech and Canada Life Sciences award for Company of the Year. \nMichael has trained more than 40 graduate students and 75 postdoctoral fellows. Many of his students have won national and international awards ranking highest in national competitions.\nMichael has initiated and leads an international effort to bring benefit to a community living with HIV/AIDS in South Africa. In collaboration with colleagues around the world, he spearheaded and built a youth-friendly recreation, counseling, and Learning Centre in direct partnership with the township of Masiphumelele in Cape Town.","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0001-5159-1419/biography"},"researcher-urls":{"last-modified-date":{"value":1410904392397},"researcher-url":[{"created-date":{"value":1410904392397},"last-modified-date":{"value":1410904392397},"source":{"source-orcid":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5159-1419","path":"0000-0001-5159-1419","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"Michael
