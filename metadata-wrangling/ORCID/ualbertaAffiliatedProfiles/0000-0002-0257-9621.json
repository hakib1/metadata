The nascent field of molecular imaging by positron emission tomography (PET) offered a graduate research project on the metabolism of the dopamine synthesis tracer [18F]fluoro-DOPA, which has remained for me an abiding interest. I meanwhile became involved in the development of PET tracers targeting dopamine and diverse other neurotransmitter system, as well as cerebral blood flow and energy metabolism. and established collaborative PET research with neurologists, neurosurgeons, and psychiatrists. In 1997 I published the monograph Imaging Dopamine (Cambridge University Press), which summarized the state of development of molecular imaging of brain dopamine. I serve on the editorial boards of a number of scientific journals including Synapse, Acta Neurologica Scandinavica, Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow & Metabolism, Neuroimage (where I served as Handling Editor) and the Journal of Neurochemistry (where I currently serve as Handling Editor).","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0002-0257-9621/biography"},"researcher-urls":{"last-modified-date":null,"researcher-url":[],"path":"/0000-0002-0257-9621/researcher-urls"},"emails":{"last-modified-date":null,"email":[],"path":"/0000-0002-0257-9621/email"},"addresses":{"last-modified-date":null,"address":[],"path":"/0000-0002-0257-9621/address"},"keywords":{"last-modified-date":{"value":1453433572542},"keyword":[{"created-date":{"value":1453433572542},"last-modified-date":{"value":1453433572542},"source":{"source-orcid":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0257-9621","path":"0000-0002-0257-9621","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"Paul Cumming"}},"content":"PET, neurochemistry, Parkinson's disease, Schizophrenia","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0002-0257-9621/keywords/89683","put-code":89683,"display-index":0}],"path":"/0000-0002-0257-9621/keywords"},"external-identifiers":{"last-modified-date":null,"external-identifier":[],"path":"/0000-0002-0257-9621/external-identifiers"},"path":"/0000-0002-0257-9621/person"}
