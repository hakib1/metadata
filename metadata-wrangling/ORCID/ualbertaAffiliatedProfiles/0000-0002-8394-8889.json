Gardner is a Research Scientist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology. He studies the Earth's cryosphere (frozen Earth) with a particular focus on glaciers and their impacts on sea level rise and water resources. He is interested in how glaciers respond to natural and human induced forcings as well as how changes in the reflectivity of snow and ice modify the Earth's climate. Alex is a member of the NASA ICEsat-2 and Sea Level Change Teams.","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0002-8394-8889/biography"},"researcher-urls":{"last-modified-date":{"value":1484089620314},"researcher-url":[{"created-date":{"value":1484089620314},"last-modified-date":{"value":1484089620314},"source":{"source-orcid":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8394-8889","path":"0000-0002-8394-8889","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"Alex Gardner"}},"url-name":null,"url":{"value":"https://science.jpl.nasa.gov/people/AGardner/"},"visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0002-8394-8889/researcher-urls/994669","put-code":994669,"display-index":1}],"path":"/0000-0002-8394-8889/researcher-urls"},"emails":{"last-modified-date":null,"email":[],"path":"/0000-0002-8394-8889/email"},"addresses":{"last-modified-date":{"value":1484089541348},"address":[{"created-date":{"value":1484089541348},"last-modified-date":{"value":1484089541348},"source":{"source-orcid":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8394-8889","path":"0000-0002-8394-8889","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"Alex Gardner"}},"country":{"value":"US"},"visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0002-8394-8889/address/608009","put-code":608009,"display-index":1}],"path":"/0000-0002-8394-8889/address"},"keywords":{"last-modified-date":{"value":1484089598053},"keyword":[{"created-date":{"value":1484089579219},"last-modified-date":{"value":1484089598053},"source":{"source-orcid":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8394-8889","path":"0000-0002-8394-8889","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"Alex Gardner"}},"content":"glacier, ice sheet, cryosphere, glaciology, sea level, remote sensing, ice, snow, albedo","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0002-8394-8889/keywords/610177","put-code":610177,"display-index":1}],"path":"/0000-0002-8394-8889/keywords"},"external-identifiers":{"last-modified-date":null,"external-identifier":[],"path":"/0000-0002-8394-8889/external-identifiers"},"path":"/0000-0002-8394-8889/person"}
