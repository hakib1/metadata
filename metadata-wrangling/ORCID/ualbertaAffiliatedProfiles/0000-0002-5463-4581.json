He received his B.S. degree in mathematics education from the Burapha University, Chonburi, Thailand, in 2000, M.S. degree (mathematics) from the Chiang Mai University, Thailand, in 2002, under the supervision of Professor Sompong Dhompongsa, and Ph.D. degree (mathematics) from the Naresuan University in 2007 under the supervision of Professor Somyot Plubtieng. His thesis title was: \"On random approximation and random fixed point theorems\". He started his occupation as a Lecturer at the Department of Mathematics, King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi (KMUTT) in 2002. In 2008, he received Grant from Franco-Thai Cooperation for short-term research at Laboratoire de Mathématiques, Université  de Bretagne Occidentale, France. Furthermore, in 2011, he had an opportunity to take a role as Visiting Professor at Kyungnam University and Gyeongsang National University, Republic of Korea. In 2012, he took the same role, Visiting Professor, at University of Alberta, Canada. Especially, he won two of the most important awards for mathematicians. The first one is TRF-CHE-Scopus Young Researcher Award in 2010 which is the award given by the corporation from three organizations, Thailand Research Fund (TRF), The Commission of Higher Education (CHE), and Elsevier Publisher (Scopus). The second award was in 2012 when he received TWAS Prize for Young Scientist in Thailand which is given by The Academy of Sciences for the Developing World TWAS (UNESCO) together with the National Research Council of Thailand. In 2014, the third award is the Fellowship Award For Outstanding Contribution to Mathematics   from International Academy of Physical Science, Allahabad, India. In 2015 Dr. Poom Kumam has been awarded Thailand Frontier Author Award 2015, Award for outstanding researcher who has published works and has often been used as a reference or evaluation criteria of the database Web of Science. Recently, In 2016 Dr. Poom Kumam has been awarded 2016 Thailand Frontier Researcher Awards on INNOVATION FORUM:  DISCOVERY, PROTECTION, COMMERCIALIZATION By INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY & SCIENCE, THOMSON REUTERS.\n\nHis research interests include fixed-point theory in both pure science and applied science. Kumam has started his research in the area of nonlinear analysis since 2000. His research targeted fixed-point theory, variational analysis, random operator theory, optimization theory, and approximation theory. He has provided and developed many mathematical tools in his fields productively over the past years. Now  in year 2017, Dr. Poom has over 400 scientific papers and projects either presented or published.","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0002-5463-4581/biography"},"researcher-urls":{"last-modified-date":null,"researcher-url":[],"path":"/0000-0002-5463-4581/researcher-urls"},"emails":{"last-modified-date":null,"email":[],"path":"/0000-0002-5463-4581/email"},"addresses":{"last-modified-date":{"value":1465226976952},"address":[{"created-date":{"value":1453659011483},"last-modified-date":{"value":1465226976952},"source":{"source-orcid":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5463-4581","path":"0000-0002-5463-4581","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"Poom Kumam"}},"country":{"value":"TH"},"visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0002-5463-4581/address/83144","put-code":83144,"display-index":0}],"path":"/0000-0002-5463-4581/address"},"keywords":{"last-modified-date":{"value":1378464678370},"keyword":[{"created-date":{"value":1378464678370},"last-modified-date":{"value":1378464678370},"source":{"source-orcid":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5463-4581","path":"0000-0002-5463-4581","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"Poom Kumam"}},"content":"fixed point, nonlinear operator, variational inequality, nonexpansive mapping, random operator","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0002-5463-4581/keywords/28521","put-code":28521,"display-index":0}],"path":"/0000-0002-5463-4581/keywords"},"external-identifiers":{"last-modified-date":{"value":1378464678369},"external-identifier":[{"created-date":{"value":1378464678369},"last-modified-date":{"value":1378464678369},"source":{"source-orcid":null,"source-client-id":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/client/0000-0002-5982-8983","path":"0000-0002-5982-8983","host":"orcid.org"},"source-name":{"value":"Scopus to ORCID"}},"external-id-type":"Scopus Author ID","external-id-value":"15056385100","external-id-url":{"value":"http://www.scopus.com/inward/authorDetails.url?authorID=15056385100&partnerID=MN8TOARS"},"external-id-relationship":"SELF","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0002-5463-4581/external-identifiers/161530","put-code":161530,"display-index":0}],"path":"/0000-0002-5463-4581/external-identifiers"},"path":"/0000-0002-5463-4581/person"}
