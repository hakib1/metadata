Thereafter he received two masters' degrees in Mechanical Engineering. The first one was from BUET with the specialization of solid mechanics and the second one was from the University of Alberta with the specialization of colloidal interactions. He worked as a Lecturer (1998–2001) and then Assistant Professor (2001–2006) of BUET. In 2006, he joined the University of Waterloo and received his Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering in 2010 with the specialization of hydrogen fuel-cells. After his Ph.D., he joined Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) as a post-doctoral fellow in 2010. Dr. Das is the author of over 70 scientific publications, including 31 peer-reviewed journal articles in the areas of electrochemical energy devices, heat transfer, multi-physics modelling, and a book chapter on fuel cells.","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0001-9096-3721/biography"},"researcher-urls":{"last-modified-date":{"value":1475079674786},"researcher-url":[{"created-date":{"value":1475079674785},"last-modified-date":{"value":1475079674786},"source":{"source-orcid":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9096-3721","path":"0000-0001-9096-3721","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"Prodip Das"}},"url-name":null,"url":{"value":"http://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/prodip.das"},"visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0001-9096-3721/researcher-urls/828017","put-code":828017,"display-index":1}],"path":"/0000-0001-9096-3721/researcher-urls"},"emails":{"last-modified-date":null,"email":[],"path":"/0000-0001-9096-3721/email"},"addresses":{"last-modified-date":null,"address":[],"path":"/0000-0001-9096-3721/address"},"keywords":{"last-modified-date":null,"keyword":[],"path":"/0000-0001-9096-3721/keywords"},"external-identifiers":{"last-modified-date":{"value":1475080106241},"external-identifier":[{"created-date":{"value":1475080106241},"last-modified-date":{"value":1475080106241},"source":{"source-orcid":null,"source-client-id":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/client/0000-0002-5982-8983","path":"0000-0002-5982-8983","host":"orcid.org"},"source-name":{"value":"Scopus to ORCID"}},"external-id-type":"Scopus Author ID","external-id-value":"56250091500","external-id-url":{"value":"http://www.scopus.com/inward/authorDetails.url?authorID=56250091500&partnerID=MN8TOARS"},"external-id-relationship":"SELF","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0001-9096-3721/external-identifiers/554110","put-code":554110,"display-index":0}],"path":"/0000-0001-9096-3721/external-identifiers"},"path":"/0000-0001-9096-3721/person"}
