Dr. Das received his Ph.D. from the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur in 2010 in the area of theoretical microfluidics. Following his Ph.D., Dr. Das joined the Physics of Fluids Group in University of Twente, the Netherlands as a Postdoc and worked on surface nanobubbles, capillarity and soft wetting. After his stint in the Netherlands, Dr. Das went for his second Postdoc in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Alberta, Canada. In Alberta, Dr. Das was honored with the Banting Postdoctoral Fellowship, the most prestigious postdoctoral fellowship of Canada.\n\nDr. Dasâ€™ research interests span different areas of micro-nanoscale fluid mechanics and interactions of soft matter with fluid mechanics. He is particularly interested in understanding issues such as the wetting of a soft solid, electrohydrodynamics past a soft interface, and evaporation-mediated self assembly of soft and rigid particles.\n\nDr. Das has authored nearly 50 journal publications, including publications in such prestigious journals as Physical Review Letters, Physical Review E, Physics of Fluids, Soft Matter, Journal of Chemical Physics,Journal of Applied Physics, and Scientific Reports.","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0002-1705-721X/biography"},"researcher-urls":{"last-modified-date":{"value":1495825075798},"researcher-url":[{"created-date":{"value":1495825075798},"last-modified-date":{"value":1495825075798},"source":{"source-orcid":null,"source-client-id":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/client/0000-0001-6478-3604","path":"0000-0001-6478-3604","host":"orcid.org"},"source-name":{"value":"Elsevier - Mendeley"}},"url-name":"Mendeley profile","url":{"value":"https://www.mendeley.com/profiles/siddhartha-das8/"},"visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0002-1705-721X/researcher-urls/1140971","put-code":1140971,"display-index":0}],"path":"/0000-0002-1705-721X/researcher-urls"},"emails":{"last-modified-date":null,"email":[],"path":"/0000-0002-1705-721X/email"},"addresses":{"last-modified-date":null,"address":[],"path":"/0000-0002-1705-721X/address"},"keywords":{"last-modified-date":null,"keyword":[],"path":"/0000-0002-1705-721X/keywords"},"external-identifiers":{"last-modified-date":null,"external-identifier":[],"path":"/0000-0002-1705-721X/external-identifiers"},"path":"/0000-0002-1705-721X/person"}
