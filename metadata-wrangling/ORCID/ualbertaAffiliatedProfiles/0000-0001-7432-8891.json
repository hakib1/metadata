I received an Independent Research Project for Undergraduates from Hubei University of Medicine in 2008 with the title of my proposal was \"The association of hypersensitivity C-reactive protein with acute myocardial infarction\" being supported by an award from the Chinese National Motivational Scholarship for Independent Research. At this stage, I decided to continue my career in medicine research. During my PhD study, I got another project from The Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities of China (\" Study on the association of the peripheral blood free fatty acids (FFAs) levels with plasma ApoA5 concentration and ApoA5 polymorphism\"). I built a protocol to detect plasma FFAs using a high-performance liquid chromatography (Clin Chim Acta 2012). This method is currently used for the patients' plasma FFAs detection in the Department of Clinical Laboratory Medicine, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, and because of it, a major Chinese National Scholarship was granted to me in 2013. In 2012, I had the opportunity to meet Dr Bifeng Yuan, who was cooperating with my supervisor. Dr. Yuan is a Major Chemistry Scholar in China. I started working with his group on my supervisorâ€™s two projects funded from the National Natural Science Foundation of China: \"The essential regulation function of miR-29/33 in the mitochondrial dysfunction and the disordered hydroxymethylation of damaged mtDNA\" and \"The regulation function of N6-Methyladenosine demethylase FTO to the glucose and lipid metabolism in T2DM\". I was also involved in another project from the National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program): \"The development of new strategy and technology for the diagnosis of serious diseases based on nucleic acid\". These steps gave me the opportunity to sparkling and galvanize my interests building a remarkable career plan for my future research. We developed a new method for an online trapping/capillary hydrophilic-interaction liquid chromatography/in-source fragmentation/tandem mass spectrometry system, able quantifying 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in genomic DNA from hepatocellular carcinoma. We also developed a sensitive liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry method for the determination of the m6A content in RNA with our innovative protocols and data published in Clin Chem, Plos One and J Clin Endocrinol Metab. In 2015, I was awarded the Academic Innovation Scholarship for my work. During my PhD study, I was also wondering to learn more knowledge in basic sciences to model and consolidate tools for health care. I met Dr Xingzhen Chen who works at the Department of Physiology of the University of Alberta during his lecture in 2013. In 2014, the Chinese Government awarded me a 1-year-scholarship as an exchange PhD student to study in Dr Chen's lab. During this stage, I met Dr Consolato Sergi, professor of Laboratory Medicine, who impressed me in the ability to conjugate basic sciences with clinical queries. Dr. Sergi's lab (BSL-2) collaborates strongly with Dr Liang Li, Department of Chemistry, both on campus, motivating my decision to continue my research in Canada.","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0001-7432-8891/biography"},"researcher-urls":{"last-modified-date":{"value":1478637537890},"researcher-url":[{"created-date":{"value":1478637537890},"last-modified-date":{"value":1478637537890},"source":{"source-orcid":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7432-8891","path":"0000-0001-7432-8891","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"Fan Shen"}},"url-name":"Fan Shen_Researchgate","url":{"value":"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Fan_Shen2"},"visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0001-7432-8891/researcher-urls/884177","put-code":884177,"display-index":1}],"path":"/0000-0001-7432-8891/researcher-urls"},"emails":{"last-modified-date":null,"email":[],"path":"/0000-0001-7432-8891/email"},"addresses":{"last-modified-date":{"value":1478637403216},"address":[{"created-date":{"value":1478637403216},"last-modified-date":{"value":1478637403216},"source":{"source-orcid":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7432-8891","path":"0000-0001-7432-8891","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"Fan Shen"}},"country":{"value":"CA"},"visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0001-7432-8891/address/569375","put-code":569375,"display-index":1}],"path":"/0000-0001-7432-8891/address"},"keywords":{"last-modified-date":{"value":1478638120930},"keyword":[{"created-date":{"value":1478638120920},"last-modified-date":{"value":1478638120920},"source":{"source-orcid":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7432-8891","path":"0000-0001-7432-8891","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"Fan Shen"}},"content":"Clinical Laboratory Sciences","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0001-7432-8891/keywords/567521","put-code":567521,"display-index":4},{"created-date":{"value":1478638120928},"last-modified-date":{"value":1478638120928},"source":{"source-orcid":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7432-8891","path":"0000-0001-7432-8891","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"Fan Shen"}},"content":"Clinical Biochemistry","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0001-7432-8891/keywords/567522","put-code":567522,"display-index":3},{"created-date":{"value":1478638120929},"last-modified-date":{"value":1478638120929},"source":{"source-orcid":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7432-8891","path":"0000-0001-7432-8891","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"Fan Shen"}},"content":"Biomarkers","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0001-7432-8891/keywords/567523","put-code":567523,"display-index":2},{"created-date":{"value":1478638120930},"last-modified-date":{"value":1478638120930},"source":{"source-orcid":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7432-8891","path":"0000-0001-7432-8891","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"Fan Shen"}},"content":"Laboratory Diagnosis","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0001-7432-8891/keywords/567524","put-code":567524,"display-index":1}],"path":"/0000-0001-7432-8891/keywords"},"external-identifiers":{"last-modified-date":null,"external-identifier":[],"path":"/0000-0001-7432-8891/external-identifiers"},"path":"/0000-0001-7432-8891/person"}
