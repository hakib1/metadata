Toosi University, Iran, in 1996 and 1999, respectively. He then received his PhD degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Western Ontario, London, ON, Canada, in 2005. In 2006, he was a post-doctoral research associate at Canadian Surgical Technologies and Advanced Robotics (CSTAR), London, ON, Canada. In 2007-2008, and prior to joining the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Alberta, Dr. Tavakoli was an NSERC Post-Doctoral Fellow with the BioRobotics Laboratory of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA. Dr. Tavakoliâ€™s research interests broadly involve the areas of robotics and systems control. Specifically, his research focuses on haptics and teleoperation control, medical robotics, and image-guided surgery.","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0002-7427-6961/biography"},"researcher-urls":{"last-modified-date":{"value":1405914068216},"researcher-url":[{"created-date":{"value":1405914068216},"last-modified-date":{"value":1405914068215},"source":{"source-orcid":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7427-6961","path":"0000-0002-7427-6961","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"Mahdi Tavakoli"}},"url-name":"Research website","url":{"value":"http://www.ece.ualberta.ca/~mtavakol"},"visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0002-7427-6961/researcher-urls/307838","put-code":307838,"display-index":0},{"created-date":{"value":1405914068216},"last-modified-date":{"value":1405914068216},"source":{"source-orcid":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7427-6961","path":"0000-0002-7427-6961","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"Mahdi Tavakoli"}},"url-name":"Lab website","url":{"value":"http://www.ece.ualberta.ca/~tbs"},"visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0002-7427-6961/researcher-urls/307839","put-code":307839,"display-index":0}],"path":"/0000-0002-7427-6961/researcher-urls"},"emails":{"last-modified-date":null,"email":[],"path":"/0000-0002-7427-6961/email"},"addresses":{"last-modified-date":null,"address":[],"path":"/0000-0002-7427-6961/address"},"keywords":{"last-modified-date":{"value":1363537680979},"keyword":[{"created-date":{"value":1363537680979},"last-modified-date":{"value":1363537680979},"source":{"source-orcid":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7427-6961","path":"0000-0002-7427-6961","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"Mahdi Tavakoli"}},"content":"Robotics and Telerobotics, Haptics and Teleoperation Control, Surgical and Therapeutic Robotics, Image-Guided Surgery","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0002-7427-6961/keywords/11149","put-code":11149,"display-index":0}],"path":"/0000-0002-7427-6961/keywords"},"external-identifiers":{"last-modified-date":{"value":1363537464836},"external-identifier":[{"created-date":{"value":1363537464836},"last-modified-date":{"value":1363537464836},"source":{"source-orcid":null,"source-client-id":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/client/0000-0002-5982-8983","path":"0000-0002-5982-8983","host":"orcid.org"},"source-name":{"value":"Scopus to ORCID"}},"external-id-type":"Scopus Author ID","external-id-value":"8668966400","external-id-url":{"value":"http://www.scopus.com/inward/authorDetails.url?authorID=8668966400&partnerID=MN8TOARS"},"external-id-relationship":"SELF","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0002-7427-6961/external-identifiers/149069","put-code":149069,"display-index":0}],"path":"/0000-0002-7427-6961/external-identifiers"},"path":"/0000-0002-7427-6961/person"}
