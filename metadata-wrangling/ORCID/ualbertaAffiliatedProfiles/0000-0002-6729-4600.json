Having trained as a Germanist (BA Honours [UCL], MA [Alberta]) and translator (FCIL), with experience as an intelligence linguist and with first-hand knowledge of the Middle East, I have come to intelligence history post-career and late in life, but hopefully not too late to fill some significant lacunae in the narrative of Anglo-German clandestine warfare, most notably with respect to the Middle East. In May 2015, I was elected a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society, becoming an Emeritus Fellow in April 2016.","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0002-6729-4600/biography"},"researcher-urls":{"last-modified-date":{"value":1494293406169},"researcher-url":[{"created-date":{"value":1446913078056},"last-modified-date":{"value":1494293406169},"source":{"source-orcid":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6729-4600","path":"0000-0002-6729-4600","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"Adrian O'Sullivan"}},"url-name":"OGC","url":{"value":"http://www.osullivanglobal.com/"},"visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0002-6729-4600/researcher-urls/570242","put-code":570242,"display-index":1}],"path":"/0000-0002-6729-4600/researcher-urls"},"emails":{"last-modified-date":null,"email":[],"path":"/0000-0002-6729-4600/email"},"addresses":{"last-modified-date":{"value":1465226976952},"address":[{"created-date":{"value":1453659989022},"last-modified-date":{"value":1465226976952},"source":{"source-orcid":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6729-4600","path":"0000-0002-6729-4600","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"Adrian O'Sullivan"}},"country":{"value":"CA"},"visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0002-6729-4600/address/263141","put-code":263141,"display-index":0}],"path":"/0000-0002-6729-4600/address"},"keywords":{"last-modified-date":null,"keyword":[],"path":"/0000-0002-6729-4600/keywords"},"external-identifiers":{"last-modified-date":null,"external-identifier":[],"path":"/0000-0002-6729-4600/external-identifiers"},"path":"/0000-0002-6729-4600/person"}
