He joined Al Akhawayn University in Ifrane (AUI), Morocco just after his graduation in January 1997. He is currently an associate professor in the School of Science and Engineering and the coordinator of the Center for Learning Technologies. His R&D research at AUI mainly focuses on renewable energies applications: energy efficiency in rural houses, solar air conditioning hybrid system, Concentric PV, and wind-hydrogen system. His research in education centers on ICT integration in science education and astronomy popularization. Dr. Darhmaoui is a co-author of more than 40 research papers and has more than 60 presentations in various conferences and scientific meetings. He was the principal investigator/coordinator of a number of funded projects. He is a member of a number of scientific societies and groups.\nDr. Darhmaoui is a Fulbright alumnus; he spent his Fulbright research at the National Institute of Standards & Technology, Boulder, Colorado, US during summer 2002.
