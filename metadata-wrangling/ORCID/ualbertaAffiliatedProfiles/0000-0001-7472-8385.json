At the end of 2008, I returned to Canada from the National Institutes of Health to Chair the Department of Ophthalmology, University of Alberta. In my role at the National Eye Institute of the NIH, in Bethesda, MD, I assisted in the development of a program on translational clinical research, applying the findings from research on genetic eye disease to improve the management of patients with heritable ocular disorders. I oversaw the Ophthalmic Genetics and Visual Function Branch comprised of over 30 staff including 5 clinician scientists, the NEI Genotyping Diagnostic Laboratory, the National Ophthalmic Genotyping Network (eyeGENEâ„¢), a visual electrophysiology core, and attendant laboratories.","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0001-7472-8385/biography"},"researcher-urls":{"last-modified-date":{"value":1445874503107},"researcher-url":[{"created-date":{"value":1445874503094},"last-modified-date":{"value":1445874503107},"source":{"source-orcid":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7472-8385","path":"0000-0001-7472-8385","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"Ian M MacDonald"}},"url-name":"Alberta Ocular Gene Therapy Team","url":{"value":"http://www.chmgenetherapy.ca"},"visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0001-7472-8385/researcher-urls/562146","put-code":562146,"display-index":0}],"path":"/0000-0001-7472-8385/researcher-urls"},"emails":{"last-modified-date":null,"email":[],"path":"/0000-0001-7472-8385/email"},"addresses":{"last-modified-date":null,"address":[],"path":"/0000-0001-7472-8385/address"},"keywords":{"last-modified-date":{"value":1370195347985},"keyword":[{"created-date":{"value":1370195347985},"last-modified-date":{"value":1370195347985},"source":{"source-orcid":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7472-8385","path":"0000-0001-7472-8385","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"Ian M MacDonald"}},"content":"Genetics, Ophthalmology, ","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0001-7472-8385/keywords/16251","put-code":16251,"display-index":0}],"path":"/0000-0001-7472-8385/keywords"},"external-identifiers":{"last-modified-date":{"value":1434994995258},"external-identifier":[{"created-date":{"value":1434994995258},"last-modified-date":{"value":1434994995258},"source":{"source-orcid":null,"source-client-id":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/client/0000-0002-5982-8983","path":"0000-0002-5982-8983","host":"orcid.org"},"source-name":{"value":"Scopus to ORCID"}},"external-id-type":"Scopus Author ID","external-id-value":"35477245200","external-id-url":{"value":"http://www.scopus.com/inward/authorDetails.url?authorID=35477245200&partnerID=MN8TOARS"},"external-id-relationship":"SELF","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0001-7472-8385/external-identifiers/290762","put-code":290762,"display-index":0}],"path":"/0000-0001-7472-8385/external-identifiers"},"path":"/0000-0001-7472-8385/person"}
