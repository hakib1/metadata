During my postdoctoral research I joined Dr. David Wishart's lab at the University of Alberta where I worked in the Human Metabolome Database, which was the first draft ever of the human metabolome. I had a leading role in the establishment of the Human Serum Metabolome and also made significant contributions to the human urine metabolome project and to another project focusing on characterizing the bovine metabolome. I worked in a variety of projects -- ranging from bovine, plant and human serum metabolomics, to characterizing kidney diseases to developing/testing metabolomics software and databases using NMR and GC/MS-based metabolomics. \nI later worked at Shriners Hospital for Children in Boston where I got trained in molecular MR imaging and HRMAS (High Resolution Magic Angle Spinning) spectroscopy to assess different states of tissue pathology in experimental tissue and animal models. I subsequently worked as a research fellow at Dr. Robert Gerszten's lab at the Cardiovascular Research Center at the Massachusetts General Hospital where I focused on understanding the molecular aspects of the cardiometabolic disease. Using LC/MS-based metabolomics we aimed at identifying novel biomarkers and pathways in translational studies of well-phenotyped human cohorts by testing various functional hypotheses in experimental animals. In particular, we identified Î±-Aminoadipic acid (2-aminoadipic acid) as a novel predictor of the development of diabetes and suggested that it is a potential modulator of glucose homeostasis in humans. In addition, we identified that the growth differentiation factor, GDF11, is a circulating Factor that reverses age-related cardiac hypertrophy in mice.\nI am currently leading the metabolomic analytical platform at the U.S. Operational Headquarters of Shire in Lexington, Massachusetts, supporting cell line and media engineering efforts as well as cell culture process development.","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0002-2747-6012/biography"},"researcher-urls":{"last-modified-date":{"value":1453824621914},"researcher-url":[{"created-date":{"value":1453824621911},"last-modified-date":{"value":1453824621911},"source":{"source-orcid":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2747-6012","path":"0000-0002-2747-6012","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"Nikolaos
