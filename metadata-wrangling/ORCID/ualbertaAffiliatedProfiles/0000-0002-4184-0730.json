My research has been focused on developing hyperspectral/multispectral approaches to extracting information on vegetation properties and better understanding spectral-chemical relations for terrestrial ecosystems. I have particular interest in an emerging spectral processing tool called continuous wavelet analysis that has been intensively used in my research and has led to new perspectives for understanding spectral responses to vegetation chemical and structural variation. My current work concentrates on multispectral and hyperspectral mapping of vegetation properties in the context of ecosystem changes.","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0002-4184-0730/biography"},"researcher-urls":{"last-modified-date":null,"researcher-url":[],"path":"/0000-0002-4184-0730/researcher-urls"},"emails":{"last-modified-date":null,"email":[],"path":"/0000-0002-4184-0730/email"},"addresses":{"last-modified-date":null,"address":[],"path":"/0000-0002-4184-0730/address"},"keywords":{"last-modified-date":{"value":1362692159083},"keyword":[{"created-date":{"value":1362692159083},"last-modified-date":{"value":1362692159083},"source":{"source-orcid":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4184-0730","path":"0000-0002-4184-0730","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"Tao Cheng"}},"content":"remote sensing, vegetation, canopy chemistry, imaging spectroscopy, water cycle","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0002-4184-0730/keywords/3232","put-code":3232,"display-index":0}],"path":"/0000-0002-4184-0730/keywords"},"external-identifiers":{"last-modified-date":{"value":1380817398073},"external-identifier":[{"created-date":{"value":1380817398073},"last-modified-date":{"value":1380817398073},"source":{"source-orcid":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7707-4137","path":"0000-0001-7707-4137","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"Clarivate Analytics"}},"external-id-type":"ResearcherID","external-id-value":"B-4807-2010","external-id-url":{"value":"http://www.researcherid.com/rid/B-4807-2010"},"external-id-relationship":"SELF","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0002-4184-0730/external-identifiers/48942","put-code":48942,"display-index":0}],"path":"/0000-0002-4184-0730/external-identifiers"},"path":"/0000-0002-4184-0730/person"}
