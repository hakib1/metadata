Farokh Atashzar, \nPostdoctoral Research Associate\nCSTAR, Lawson Health Research Institute \nT: 519-685-8500 ext. 36492. \n\nDr. Atashzar obtained his B.Sc. degree in Electrical Engineering/Control Systems from K. N. Toosi University of Technology, Iran, in 2008 and his M.Sc. degree in Mechatronics from Amirkabir University of Technology, Iran, in 2011. Farokh joined University of Western Ontario (UWO), Canada, in 2011 to pursue his Ph.D. degree under the supervision of Dr. Rajni V. Patel. In 2012 and 2013, he was a doctoral trainee in the NSERC CREATE program in Computer-Assisted Medical Interventions (CAMI). He serves as a visiting research scholar at the University of Alberta, Canada, in 2014. In 2015 and 2016 he was a doctoral trainee of the NCE program on “Aging Gracefully across Environments using Technology to Support Wellness, Engagement and Long Life (AGE-WELL)”. Farokh received his Ph.D. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) from UWO in 2016. During his Ph.D., Farokh received several awards. He was among the very few international students at UWO awarded an Ontario Graduate Scholarship in 2013. He won two outstanding presentation awards at the Department of ECE (UWO) in two consecutive years (2014 and 2015). Currently, Farokh is a postdoctoral research associate in the Department of ECE at UWO and Canadian Surgical Technologies and Advanced Robotics (CSTAR) . His research has been published in more than 20 journal papers and 25 peer-reviewed conference papers, so far. He was a co-organizer of the workshop on “Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics for Neuromuscular Rehabilitation and Recovery Assessment” which was held in 2016 IEEE/ASME AIM Conference, Banff, Canada. He is a technical co-chair of the “Symposium on Advanced Bio-signal Processing for Rehabilitation & Assistive Systems”, which will be held in 2017 IEEE GlobalSIP, Montreal, Canada. He also serves as a co-organizer of the special invited session on Bio-Signal Processing for Movement Assessment, NeuroRehabilitation and Assistive Technologies, which will be held in  \n 2017 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC2017), Banff, Canada.","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0001-8495-8440/biography"},"researcher-urls":{"last-modified-date":{"value":1486332234593},"researcher-url":[{"created-date":{"value":1486332234593},"last-modified-date":{"value":1486332234593},"source":{"source-orcid":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8495-8440","path":"0000-0001-8495-8440","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"Dr. Seyed Farokh Atashzar"}},"url-name":"Google Scholar","url":{"value":"https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=H6_aG50AAAAJ&hl=en"},"visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0001-8495-8440/researcher-urls/1041933","put-code":1041933,"display-index":1}],"path":"/0000-0001-8495-8440/researcher-urls"},"emails":{"last-modified-date":null,"email":[],"path":"/0000-0001-8495-8440/email"},"addresses":{"last-modified-date":{"value":1486332249519},"address":[{"created-date":{"value":1486332249519},"last-modified-date":{"value":1486332249519},"source":{"source-orcid":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8495-8440","path":"0000-0001-8495-8440","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"Dr. Seyed Farokh Atashzar"}},"country":{"value":"CA"},"visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0001-8495-8440/address/625767","put-code":625767,"display-index":1}],"path":"/0000-0001-8495-8440/address"},"keywords":{"last-modified-date":null,"keyword":[],"path":"/0000-0001-8495-8440/keywords"},"external-identifiers":{"last-modified-date":null,"external-identifier":[],"path":"/0000-0001-8495-8440/external-identifiers"},"path":"/0000-0001-8495-8440/person"}
