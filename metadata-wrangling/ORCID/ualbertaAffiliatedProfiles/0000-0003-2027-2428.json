I have 25 years experience in running an independent multidisciplinary translational research laboratory investigating novel therapies for genitourinary malignancies. Research projects have included the development of lasers, light delivery and dosimetry equipment, drug development, drug delivery techniques, rationale combination drug regimes, imaging strategies, oncolytic virus therapy, gene therapy, immune therapy, transplantation, animal model development, tissue banking, clinical trials and observational outcomes studies. I have taken photodynamic therapy for prostate and bladder cancer from inception to clinical application, including commercialization with a biotechnology company. I have taken laser photoablation of upper tract urothelial cancer and stones from inception to clinical application in the capital health region. Clinically I performed the first successful renal cell caval thrombectomy under hypothermic circulatory arrest with a multidisciplinary team that I assembled at our institution.  I have trained the next generation of surgeon-scientists, including undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate and have received a mentoring award from the Faculty of Medicine following nomination by my students. It is these students that drive research forward. I am involved locally, nationally and internationally with specialty research groups in uro-oncology and transplantation. This involvement provides the segway for multi-institutional clinical trials. I have a strong interest and motivation to improve the lives of patients afflicted with bladder cancer.","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0003-2027-2428/biography"},"researcher-urls":{"last-modified-date":null,"researcher-url":[],"path":"/0000-0003-2027-2428/researcher-urls"},"emails":{"last-modified-date":null,"email":[],"path":"/0000-0003-2027-2428/email"},"addresses":{"last-modified-date":{"value":1472573324842},"address":[{"created-date":{"value":1472573324842},"last-modified-date":{"value":1472573324842},"source":{"source-orcid":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2027-2428","path":"0000-0003-2027-2428","host":"orcid.org"},"source-client-id":null,"source-name":{"value":"Ronald Moore"}},"country":{"value":"CA"},"visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0003-2027-2428/address/523862","put-code":523862,"display-index":1}],"path":"/0000-0003-2027-2428/address"},"keywords":{"last-modified-date":null,"keyword":[],"path":"/0000-0003-2027-2428/keywords"},"external-identifiers":{"last-modified-date":{"value":1472145217336},"external-identifier":[{"created-date":{"value":1472145217336},"last-modified-date":{"value":1472145217336},"source":{"source-orcid":null,"source-client-id":{"uri":"http://orcid.org/client/0000-0002-5982-8983","path":"0000-0002-5982-8983","host":"orcid.org"},"source-name":{"value":"Scopus to ORCID"}},"external-id-type":"Scopus Author ID","external-id-value":"55484218100","external-id-url":{"value":"http://www.scopus.com/inward/authorDetails.url?authorID=55484218100&partnerID=MN8TOARS"},"external-id-relationship":"SELF","visibility":"PUBLIC","path":"/0000-0003-2027-2428/external-identifiers/533930","put-code":533930,"display-index":0}],"path":"/0000-0003-2027-2428/external-identifiers"},"path":"/0000-0003-2027-2428/person"}
