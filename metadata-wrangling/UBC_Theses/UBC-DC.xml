      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" lang="en">"This study in public administration examines an attempt to establish and sustain formal co-operation among police, social service, parole and probation agencies in prevention of crime and related social problems. The setting for this attempt was the Police and Community Services Project in Vancouver, British Columbia. The Project, as it was called, ran from September 1974- to March 31, 1977. It was developed in the south-east quadrant of Vancouver with the participation of the above named agencies, the B.C. Police Commission, and the B.C. Justice Development Commission. Examination of the Project and events which led to its inception is undertaken to test the hypothesis that sustained, formal co-operation among public agencies requires the likelihood of benefits to each participant. The hypothesis is drawn, in part, from Antonio Jorge's ""Competition, Co-operation, Efficiency, and Social Organization"", and Anthony Downs' ""Inside Bureaucracy"". Both writers maintain that co-operation is often motivated by the likelihood of rewards such as power, prestige, and additional resources. However, herein the motive is shown to be of greater importance in formal as compared to informal co-operation due, in part, to the longer term commitment and greater degree of involvement required of participants. Formal co-operation is defined as a formally constituted or recognized interaction in which agencies and their officials agree to combine their activities in an organized manner for the promotion of common ends or objectives in such a way that the greater success of one party to the interaction, the greater the success of the other party or parties. Also, the interaction is usually governed by formal rules and is subject to scrutiny by a higher authority. This definition denotes the need for goal consensus which, in turn, may signify that participants perceive a likelihood of benefits. Informal co-operation among police, probation and social service agencies prior to the Project (1963 - 1974) is examined to show development of the belief among all agencies that formal co-operation would improve the effectiveness of agency and police services. On the basis of this shared belief, the Vancouver Police Department developed support for the Project and encouraged participation of social agencies. This was facilitated by the fact that the police and most social agencies were, in 1974&gt; decentralizing services to increase effectiveness in treating crime and social problems and were seeking clearer role definitions. Reorganization of social service agencies was also a response to the social policies of a New Democratic Party provincial government. The Project was fraught with difficulties from its inception. Representatives of agencies who were expected to manage the Project were unable to agree on viable objectives for the Project. As the Project lacked a clear sense of direction, the police proposed experimentation with a team policing system (that is, reorganization of the police in the Project area into six neighbourhood teams with constables assigned on a permanent basis) to facilitate co-ordination of police and social agency services. All Project participants agreed to the experiment as it provided the Project with a concrete goal. However, concentration on team policing fed perceptions of social agencies that the Project was a ""police project"" rather than an inter-agency endeavour. But this concentration came about, in part, because of lack of strong social agency commitment to the Project. This was due largely to the preoccupation of agencies with changes in their own organizations resulting from a change to a Social Credit Party provincial government (December 1975) with conservative social policies. Also, the dominant role of the police in the Project appeared to lessen the likelihood of benefits to social agencies and, therefore, lessened their commitment. These factors are considered as major influences determining the Project's failure to sustain formal co-operation. In contrast, field teams of police and agency workers in the team policing experiment developed a consensus on how to work together, whenever possible, while respecting each other's functional autonomy. Thus, they reverted to informal co-operation in co-ordination of services. This thesis suggests, then, that informal co-operation may be more effective than formal co-operation, even though likelihood of benefit is present, in improving co-ordination (albeit on a more limited scale) among diverse public agencies."</dcvalue>

      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" lang="en">The cases of recreation in the Sea-to-Sky Corridor and Peace Foothills in British Columbia are used toexplore the issues of the representation of outdoor recreation in land-use planning and the participation ofrecreationists in land-use planning. The widening array of outdoor recreation activities in high-use areasposes new challenges to the equitable participation of diverse recreation user groups in land-useplanning. How well have past land-use planning exercises represented the needs of outdoorrecreationists? How well represented do participants of newer recreation activities feel? Moreover, whoshould represent these diverse groups? There has, to date, been very little research in this area.In an attempt to explore these questions and begin building a theoretical framework for understanding keyrelationships, this study measures recreationists' perceptions of representation in land-use planning andtheir participation in land-use planning in the Sea-to-Sky Corridor and Peace Foothills. Relationshipsbetween recreation use and socio-economic characteristics and recreationists' participation andperceptions of representation in land-use planning were examined. Moderate levels of perceivedrepresentation were found for most recreation groups, although some users seemed unclear about howwell they were represented. In sum, some socio-economic characteristics (household income, age, andeducation) were associated with a person's participation in land-use planning; this influence extended toperceived representation through aspects of social capital, as membership in an outdoor recreation cluband degree of recreation specialization were associated with perceived representation. The localness ofrecreationists played a role in their participation in land-use planning; localness also was associated withperceived representation. Outdoor recreation characteristics (recreation specialization, activity choice,the number of activities participated in, annual participation, and club membership) had an influence onrecreationists' likelihood of participation in land-use planning. Logistic regression models suggested thatrecreation specialization and household income contributed to respondents' perceptions of representationin land-use planning; age, recreation specialization, the number of recreation activities participated in,club membership, and local residence contributed to respondents' likelihood of having been a participantof a land-use planning process. The results of this study support four land-use planning strategies thatmay assist planners in increasing actual and perceived representation of recreationists.</dcvalue>

      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" lang="en">Walter de la Mare has always been known as a writer of fantasy and supernatural fiction. It is proposed here that he is, in fact, concerned with exploration of the conscious and unconscious selves. His exploration is more philosophical than psychological in that he makes no use of Freudian formulas. He follows rather the intuitive approach of Jung but uses the media of fiction and, thereby, imagery, to show the possibilities of man's infinite mind.He uses images of doors, windows, water and mirrors to show how the conscious and unconscious selves, the real and astral selves, are divided by lack of understanding, by refusal to accept the other, and by total denial of one another. But he shows also how they may be united across these barriers once they are seen as thresholds between one and the other, that union of the two selves as one integral whole makes for happiness in understanding. He uses the present as an image of the threshold between past and future in which the individual stands in command of primeval memory and his future experience.In all his prose fiction, de la Mare is concerned with man in his present, real, world crossing the boundary into the world of the spirit, the astral world. The real self, the physical human body, serves as container for the spiritual, though the make-up of that unconscious self should, ideally, be seen in the face. It is attainment of that ideal which is a major theme in de la Mare's prose fiction.</dcvalue>

      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" lang="en">A HeÂ³ cryostat was designed for steady state nuclear magnetic resonance measurements. The cryostat required about one liter of HeÂ³ at NTP. This amount of HeÂ³ was liquified at 1.2Â°K, which was the temperature of the surrounding liquid Heâ&#x81;´ bath, and then pumped on by means of a four-stage mercury diffusion pump. By this procedure, a liquid HeÂ³ temperature of 0.35 K was achieved and maintained for four hours. The r-f coil and sample were in direct contact with the liquid HeÂ³ to ensure sufficient heat transfer between the two. The temperature of the liquid HeÂ³ was measured by means of vapour pressure measurements of the evaporating HeÂ³ and by means of resistance measurements of a carbon resistance in contact with the liquid HeÂ³. The system was non-recirculating, since a total, uninterrupted run of four hours was considered long enough for most experiments. The HeÂ³ could also be retransferred within 20 minutes after such a run, and this process could be continued until in-sufficient quantities of liquid Heâ&#x81;´remained to cool the surroundings.</dcvalue>

      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" lang="en">The imperial praetorian guard was an elite unit of the Roman army,whose primary responsibility was to safeguard the emperor and his family.Adapted from a republican institution by Augustus, it in essence formed thepersonal army of the emperor. Yet, within a very short time, the praetoriansbecame responsible for specialized military tasks involving issues of security,and for various administrative duties in Rome. This evolution occurred primarilybecause of the close relationship between the guard and the emperor, who sawthat such a large number of soldiers in the city could be put to good use for hisown benefit, and for the advantage of the state. Not only would they assist in themanagement of the capital, they also would serve as a constant reminder to thepopulace of the substantial armed force that formed the basis of imperial rule.Previous studies of the guard have concentrated on its organization androle as the imperial bodyguard. Yet it is through an examination of the otherresponsibilities of the praetorians that a more comprehensive understanding oftheir position in the state can be deduced. The purpose of the present study is toexamine those aspects of the guard that are outside its basic mandate ofproviding protection for the imperial household. The development of thepraetorians into a unit that carried out political espionage, fought fires in the city,and was employed as security at the games provides insight into the nature ofthe early principate, which relied on armed force to maintain its authority. Theexpanded role of the guard in the Julio-Claudian period can be viewed as the deliberate integration of the military into the fabric of Roman administration. Byplacing soldiers who owed their allegiance only to him in key roles in the capital,the emperor was able to consolidate his hold on power while, at the same time,often providing much needed services that benefited the state as a whole.</dcvalue>

      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" lang="en">A new approach to the study of the human Visual Evoked Potential is described, based on a simple model of the visual system. This model is then used as a tool for the investigation of the visual system and its characteristics. Certain assumptions are made concerningthe spontaneous brain activity accompanying the visual responseand this activity is then described by its probability density and auto-correlation functions. A theoretical basis is described for the two noise reduction techniques of ensemble averaging and the sliding mean and the implications of these processing procedures as applied to the visual system are discussed with reference to the systemmodel. The theoretical assumptions of this analysis are then experimentally investigated. The nature of the visual response is discussed and it is shown that this response can be subdivided into two components on the basis of their time behaviour. Each of these two components, the V.E.P. and the Rhythmic After-discharge is investigatedin detail. The relation of the Alpha Rhythm to the After-discharge is also investigated using auto-correlation techniques. Finally, a statistical model for the V.E.P. is described as a means for studying and applying the visual response, its uses, being discussedin some detail.An electronic coding scheme was designed to facilitate the cataloguing of experimental data, and is described in the Appendix.</dcvalue>

      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" lang="en">This thesis considers the Pacific Great Eastern Railway, theBritish Columbia Railway as of April 1, 1972, a Provincial Crown corporation,and the implications of its extensions upon regional development. The indicators of regional development studied are population and industrialprofiles. The time framework of the thesis is from 1952 to 1972, the period of the P.G.E. extensions.Two perspectives of the implications for regional development are examined. Chapter Two treats with the Provincial Government agencies whose policies have had the most effect in the study area. The financing, safety, and freight rate implications of the P.G.E. are discussed. In addition, general policies and inter-relationships with the P.G.E. of the following Provincial agencies are considered: B.C. Hydro, the Department of Highways, and the Forest Service.The third through sixth chapters consider the regional development of four regions: Squamish-Cariboo, Prince George, Peace River-Liard, and Omineca-Stikine. These regions, in turn, are broken into areasâ€”usually to correspond with a central P.G.E. railway station and its commodity carloadings. The development within each area is studied in respect to populationchanges and industrial expansion since 1951.The P.G.E. commodity carloadings from 1966 through 1970 are used as indicators of regional development. The fluctuations of the carloadings of certain commodities, such as woodchips, lumber and veneer, merchandise, and machinery and parts, have been used to show the level of regional industrialdevelopment.Alone, the P.G.E. commodity carloadings are of little use. However,they take on more meaning in light of the policies of the Provincial Government agencies. The usefulness of the data takes a quantum leap when individual shippers indicate how much they ship, its routing, and its final destination.A limited attempt at this later refinement is provided by the responsesof about fifty company and government officials to a single page, open-ended question letter. Most of these responses are in letter form although those companies with offices in Vancouver are interviews.A limitation of the technique used in this thesis to determine regional development is the inability to estimate the importance of the servicesector. The obvious weight is given to the resource extraction and manufacturing sectors since these are the sectors which generate railway carloadings. Only when there is a significant population and the total carloadings are relatively low, are there suspicions of a large service sector or the possibility of significant truck shipments.The general conclusion to this thesis is that the Pacific Great Eastern Railway has stimulated regional development in the areas it serves directly. However, this development has been primarily in the forest products industry, in conjunction with Forest Service policies and technologicalimprovements. The development of this industry has then provided a stimulus for maintenance and repair services and a more stable population base, which has helped to establish a need for improved highways.</dcvalue>

      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" lang="en">The near-threshold fatigue crack propagation behavior of a-phase copper alloys in desiccatedair and several aqueous environments has been investigated. Three commercial alloys ofnominal composition Cu-30Ni (Cu-Ni), Cu-30Zn (Cu-Zn) and 90Cu-7Al-3Fe (Cu-Al) weretested. Fatigue tests were conducted using standard prefatigued single edged notched (SEN)specimens loaded in tension at a high frequency of ~100 Hz. Different R-ratios wereemployed, mostly at i?-ratios of 0.5. Low loading levels were used that corresponded to thethreshold and near-threshold regions where Î”K[sub th] &lt; Î”K &lt; 11 MPaâˆšm.Fatigue tests in the aqueous solutions showed that the effect of different corrosiveenvironments during high frequency testing (~100 Hz) was not as pronounced as wasexpected when compared relative to air. Further testing revealed that environmental effectswere present and fatigue crack growth rates were influenced by the fluid-induced closureeffects which are generally reported in the fatigue literature to be operative only in viscousliquids, not in aqueous solutions. It was concluded that high frequency testing in aqueousenvironments consistently decreased crack growth rates in a manner similar to crackretardation effects in viscous fluids. Several theoretical models reported in the literature haveunderestimated, if not failed, to adequately predict the fluid induced closure in aqueoussolutions.Results from the desiccated air tests confirmed that, under closure-free conditions (high Rratios),both threshold values and fatigue crack growth rate of stage II can be related toYoung's modulus, in agreement with results from the literature. The role of differentmechanical and environmental variables on fatigue behavior becomes most visible in the lowi?-ratio regime, and contribute to various closure processes.</dcvalue>

      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" lang="en">A mathematical model of the nickel converter has been developed based on the assumption that the converting reactions pass through a finite series of equilibrium steps. The model predicts the bath temperature and the composition of the three phases present. Detailed data collected during in-plant trials are used to test the validity of the model predictions.__The model is found to give relatively accurate predictions for the first blows of a converting charge, but overpredicts both temperature and iron removal during the last blows. The errors in the last blows are expected to be caused by the converting reactions coming under liquid phase mass transport control. An analysis of some of the more important variables in a converter operation indicates that, according to the assumption of equilibrium, there is very little that can be done to chemically improve the converting process.</dcvalue>

      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" lang="en">Two alfalfa varieties differing in root characteristics were studied under the climatic conditions existing at Agassiz, in the Lower Fraser Valley of British Columbia. The soil type of the experimental area was Monroe fine, sandy loam underlain with gravel.A preliminary study of plant densities in old established plots of alfalfa was conducted in the spring of 1951. The main study commenced in the early summer of 1951 and the first harvest data were obtained in 1952.Ladak alfalfa, a tap-rooted variety, and Rhizoma alfalfa, a branched-rooted variety, were grown in separate associations with Hercules orchardgrass and with Parkland bromegrass. Two planting methods, seeding and spaced-planting of seedlings, were compared as methods for obtaining the optimum rate of planting for alfalfa. Comparisons based on yield of dry matter were made between the two alfalfa varieties In relation to their response to the following factors:(a) Density of alfalfa in the association --(1) Seeded at three rates(2) Spaced-planted at three densities.(b) Cutting managements --(1) Clipping as continuous pasture(2) Cutting at the hay stage, followed by clipping the aftermath to simulate pasturing(3) Taking two cuts at the hay stage and a third cut at the silage or early hay stage.(c) The grass associate --(1) Orchardgrass(2) Bromegrass.The findings presented are of the first harvest year of a continuing study.The two alfalfa varieties displayed a similar response to treatments. The tap-rooted variety Ladak produced more dry matter than did the branched-rooted variety Rhizoma.Superiority was not established for one grass over the other as the grass associate.Nearly identical results were obtained between methods of planting. The indications were that spaced-planting with its higher cost was only suitable for basic forage studies.The highest rate of planting gave the greatest yield of dry matter. However, the results are inconclusive as the effect of plant spread has not been determined.The spreading habit of Rhizoma was established for the particular area of the study. Its effect on managements has not been established.The hay cutting management produced the greatest yield of dry matter.The continued study will stress the effect of cutting managements, including interval between cuts, date of last fall cut, and date of first spring cut, on the root reserves and the production of nutrients per acre.</dcvalue>

One mole each of aspartic acid and of glutamic acid have been identified as the free Î±-amino terminal residues. In bovine Î³-golubin, free amino groups are located on five different amino acid residues, namely, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, serine, alanine and valine. Each is present in sub-molar quantity indicating that the protein is heterogeneous with respact to N-terminal groups.By a combination of the carboxypeptidase and of the hydrazinolysis methods, one mole each of serine and glycine have been established as the C-terminal amino acids of human Î³-globulin. The free carboxyl terminal groups of bovine Î³-globulln also have been found to be serine and glycine. Carboxypeptidase erperiments indicate that there is no difference in the release of free amino acid from bovine Î³-globulin and human Î³-globulin. The C-terminal sequence of these proteins is probably the same. In one chain, serine may be followed by leucine and valine.</dcvalue>

      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" lang="en">Understanding the trajectories of particulate solids inside a flow-through reactor, such as the riser of a recirculating fluidized bed, is a basic requisite to accurately modelling the reactor. However, these trajectories, which are complicated by gross internal recirculation,are not readily measurable. Conventional means of measuring the residence time distribution can be applied to closed boundaries, such as the exit of the riser. Doing so, however, does not directly provide the details of the trajectories within the riser. In order to determine these trajectories, meaningful measurements must be made at the open boundaries between the adjacent axial regions which, in total, make up the riser. Transient tracer concentration measurements at open boundaries are ambiguous because, as tracer material recirculates past the sensor, its concentration is repeatedly recorded, with no distinction as to which region (above or below the boundary) it has just resided in.A method designed to eliminate this ambiguity at open boundaries is reported in this thesis. By repeatedly introducing single tracer particles into the riser, and measuring the time of passage through each axial region, the residence time distributions for each region can be obtained from the frequency density of these times. The crux of this approach is being able to sense individual tracer particles. The major thrust of this investigation has been to find a practical means to this end. The final sensor considered in this investigation is based on electromagnetic induction: a magnetic primary field induces an eddy current in a conductive tracer particle, and the resulting secondary field is sensed, indicating the presence of the tracer particle in the sensing volume. Noise, resulting from direct coupling between transmitter and receiver coils, electrostatics, and vibrations, determines the sensitivity of the device. The final prototype sensor is limited in sensitivity to relatively large tracer particles, and it is incapable of measuring tracer velocity. Nevertheless, the trajectory of large particles is of practical significance for circulating fluidized beds. Limited tests were conducted in a 0.15 m ID x 9.14 m tall acrylic riser where the tracer particles were injected opposite the solids re-entry point, and were sensed by a single sensor located at an open boundary 7.5 m downstream. At each of the two superficial gas velocities considered, and above a threshold solids flux, the time-of-flight frequency density between the injector and the sensor for these large tracer particles does not change with increasing flux of the fine solids. This result is incongruous with obvious changes in the macro-flow structure occurring in the riser.Recommended changes in the sensor would allow measurement of the direction and speed of the tracer, as it passes by the sensor, as well as potentially reducing noise. With these improvements, it would be useful to install multiple sensors along the full length ofthe riser. The information obtainable from such a configuration would greatly enhance understanding of the detailed trajectories within the riser.</dcvalue>

      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" lang="en">This thesis addresses the question of how a dialogue may be developed between the socio-political notion ofpluralism and a pluralistic public sphere, and the design of public space and public architecture. Moreparticularly, it considers how architecture may both accommodate multiple publics while simultaneouslyframing connection or association between them. Following an exploration of this question at an abstract,theoretical level, the thesis moves to a more specific architectural investigation. This investigation takes theform of a design project situated within the Robson Square complex in downtown Vancouver. The complex,constructed in the mid-1970's, was designed by Canada's pre-eminent architect Arthur Erickson and is themajor civic space in the city. The thesis design project undertakes a theoretical re-evaluation and physicalrenovation of this Utopian mega-structure, with the intention of shifting the existing homogeneity andinstitutionality of the complex to align it with the thesis argument.Through the vehicle of a design project,, the abstract theoretical argument is translated and focused through theparticularities of an architecture embedded in its site. This methodology requires the project to address issuesconnected to the existing masterwork, including: the question of how to conceptualize monumentally in a gridcity; the relationship between the 'sacred' space of the civic circumstance and the 'profane' space of the streetand commercial program; the form of the institution within the city; and the issue of working within, andmanipulating, a pre-existing architectural language. Further, the scale of the site is reflected in the scope of thedesign project. The project moves from the development of urban design strategies to the detailed considerationof the material and construction of the different interventions. The architecture remains, however, conceptualand is a demonstration of how the developed strategies may generate form and guide program. Theproject does not attempt to fully develop a building in detail.The thesis concludes with an afterword on the success of the project as a demonstration of the thesis argument.At the same time, the limits of architecture to act as a socio-political device are acknowledged. Further,speculations are made as to the way in which the position and the strategies developed within the thesis mightinform wider discussions on architecture and the urbanism of grid cities such as Vancouver. The key conceptforming the basis of these speculations is the idea of a 'difficult' co-existence of parts and a whole, reflectingthe pluralistic ideal of association within fragmentation.</dcvalue>

      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" lang="en">Pediatric home care for children with medically complex conditions is a growing phenomenon made possible by parents willing and able to care for these children at home. While pediatric home care may decrease costs to the health care system, and provide social and developmental benefits to these children, their parents often have limited child care options which would enable them to rejuvenate from parenting activities and fulfil l other roles and responsibilities. To illuminate this child care dilemma, this study examines how parents of children with medically complexconditions choose to utilize in-home pediatric nursing respite care as a source of child care. This investigation constitutes one part of a larger multi-variable, pre-post descriptive design study evaluating the Nursing Respite Program in British Columbia, Canada. To explore the process by which parents use nursing respite as child care, qualitative data from first (prerespite service) and second (six-months after beginning service) visits with the parents from six families were analyzed using grounded theory. Interviews and accompanying field notes were audiotaped and transcribed for analysis using the constant comparative method. Study findings indicate that parents of children with medically complex conditions choose to utilize nursing respite as child care through a process of perpetual innovation. Throughout this process, dynamic situational factors require parents to continually modify their use of nursing respite care in relation to other forms of childcare. In a cyclical manner, parents repeatedly adopt strategies aimed at creating child care situations that are mutually beneficial to both parent and child. Together, these strategies suggest a decision-making framework embedded within the process of perpetual innovation. While literature related to these study findings is sparse, the findings are discussed within the context of research on child care, respite care, and parenting children with chronic conditions. In addition, conceptual cues which may be used to integrate study findings into the larger evaluation study are identified. Finally, policy implications of study findings are discussed in relation to pediatric respite cafe delivery.</dcvalue>

      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" lang="en">"The objective of this study is to investigate the existing air and noise pollution abatement legislation in Canada as it relates to the air transportation industry, and suggest methods of improving this legislation to meet the future needs and demands of the human environment. A second objective is to provide guidelines for business and government action in the future, and to acquaint the individual with some of the issues of the ""environmental era of air transportation.""Based on personal interview, an extensive literature search, and the application of business principles, this study addresses the technical, economic and social problems associated with the formulation and implementation of effective environmental legislation. In addition, it discusses the roles of business and government in each of these problem areas.The thesis concludes that the Canadian legal system must undergo structural change to accommodate environmental issues; a 1973 Noise Control Act should be passed; and a federally supported environmental education program should be instituted. Other conclusions include recommendations for increased research on the effects of the sonic boom and inadvertent climate modification, increased international participation in environmental affairs, and an improved market system to reflect environmental goods as scarce resources. This thesis also recommends increased government-industry cooperation in the formulation of technical and nontechnical standards and legislation, to ensure that reasonable and specific criteria are established for noise and air pollution abatement. The most important recommendation of this thesis is that a macro system approach be adopted in environmental management. This approach, which recognizes interactions and feedback in the social, economic and political environment, is vital to the future of Air Transportation and the Human Environment."</dcvalue>

      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" lang="en">"As an open pedagogical invitation, my dissertation is a contribution as critical interpretive ontology with the promise of hope based upon my father's Dao Li, or principled living as a quest for the good. An embodied sense of narrative as unity of life interweaves within my exploratory work bringing together virtue, praxis and narrative. Arising out of an existential angst in the passing of my father and in my attempts to grapple with the questions he posed, I wrote autopoietically "" from the middle"" out of life within the space between life, topic, theory and method. I was motivated by my deep concern that, as educators, we are caught within a cycle of the reification of life making us complicit in the ecological crisis of modernity. Situated within the conceptual genre of educational research, my work interprets modern conceptions of nature as deeply flawed, wherein the loss of nature from the discourse of modernity is implicated in the general loss of meaning and sense of loss of the sacred. Within this context, I interpret reification in an expanded Lukacsian sense, to be the supreme danger to life, even over capital, when modern discourse looms large, threatening to preclude all other ways of being. To recover a language and meaning in nature, I draw from the hermeneutical-phenomenological tradition, casting my work as onto-linguistic in immediacy within what I call quotidian pedagogy. My exegesis is located in the dialectical flux between reification and immediacy. Within this flux, I postulate three interventionist movements that I have labelled appropriately as deconstructive, topographic, and immediate, around a circuit of nature model. This heuristic traces the pathway from construction to waste and sedimentation, through three movements that collectively: 1) recover nature through tracing the loss of nature from the discourse; 2) remap modern discourse to include nature; 3) experience and deconstruct the present in immediacy over abstraction. Pedagogically, I feature interpretations of the everyday and lived curriculum over the planned curriculum. I cast my contribution to immediacy within these lessons of the immediate. Moreover, I argue that it is in these spaces of the immediate as they are occurring before us that we find the possibility for hope and escape from the circularity of reification."</dcvalue>

      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" lang="en">The subject of the relations of Vigny with England includes the consideration of such matters as his knowledge of the language, his travels in England, his marriage with Lydia Bunbury, his many English friends and the number of English characters in his work. These are dealt with in the introduction.Shakespeare's influence is the topic of the first chapter. The nature of this influence on Vigny emerges from the study of his aims in translating Shakespeare and his qualifications for this work. A discussion of the translations themselvesâ€” le More de Venise, the fragments of RomÃ©o et Juliette, and Shylockâ€”purposes to show their excellence, especially in comparison with preceding translations and in consideration of the difficulties facing the producer of Shakespeare on the French stage of the time. Vigny's original work written under the Shakesperean influence is mainly confined to la MarÃ©chale d'Ancre, but Vigny's admiration for the great English dramatist should not be underestimated.The second chapter deals with Milton and Vigny. The fact that elsewhere this subject has been much less thoroughly treated than the influence of Shakespeare or of Byron accounts for the comparative length of this part of the study. Opening with a discussion of Milton's role in French romanticism it seeks to establish that it was through Chateaubriand that Vigny came to know Milton. A reason for Vigny's admiration for the English poet is suggested: Milton exemplifies Vigny's favourite paradox of the mission and the suffering of the poet as revealed, for instance, in the characterization in Cinq-Mars. The influence of Milton's work (mainly Paradise Lost) on Vigny's is treated in great detail, distinction being made between the passages of Paradise Lost which are to be found in le GÃ©nie or les Martyrs and the much smaller number which Vigny must have found elsewhere. Eloa, the fragments of Satan sauvÃ© and of le Jugement Dernier are by far the most important works of Vigny in this regard and are considered first, after a short digression upon the meaning of Eloa. A more general comparison between the characters and atmosphere of the work of Milton and of Vigny necessitates mention of Moore and ends with a brief analysis of French Satanism and its culmination in Baudelaire. After tracing Milton through the rest of Vigny's work (notably in la ColÃ¨re de Samson, le DÃ©luge, and MoÄ­se) the chapter ends with a contrast and comparison of the philosophical and religious views of the two writers, showing Vigny to be not a pessimist, but an idealist; not a fatalist, but a believer in a partial predestination in which free-will remains important.Byron is treated in the third chapter, which studies first in general terms his influence on Vigny, passing on to a discussion of Byronism in France and its great importance in the romantic movement. The poems written before 1826 are the first to be treated, since they show the most evident traces of Byron. The approach is quite different from that adopted in the chapter on Milton; no attempt at a complete analysis is made. A few examples taken from Vignyâ€™s later works are followed by a series of contrasts between Byron and Vigny, with the aim of disproving the popular contention that Vigny*s philosophy owes much to Byron.The conclusion, mentioning other influences upon Vigny, stresses his originality, his greatness, his influence, and his significance today.</dcvalue>

      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" lang="en">"A study of the cut-over and immature forest associations in the Douglas-fir zone on eastern Vancouver Island was carried out as a continuation of earlier investigations (Krajina and Spilsbury 1950, Krajina 1952, Szczawinski 1953, McMinn 1957) of the associations in mature stands of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii). Information of the environmental characteristics of the associations has been extended and their vegetational aspects in the early stages of secondary succession after logging operations are described and evaluated.It is pointed out that a set of physiographic positions is typical for each association. However, similar physiographic positions may be occupied by different associations depending upon the configuration of the soil. The soils vary with type of parent material, geographical location and physiographic position within each association. In spite of this heterogeneity it is often possible to recognize a certain association through the soil, because of common pedological characteristics related to soil genesis, moisture regime and rhizosphere characteristics. Trends and some significant site correlations are demonstrated between soil reaction and humus horizon and soil reaction and lower solum, as well as between per cent organic matter of the humus and upper solum of the association type soils. A few representative samples from soil profiles preserved as monoliths give indications of a positive trend of replaceable calcium and magnesium with the B horizons of the association type soils, increasing along the moisture gradient of the ecological series of association from dry to wet.Forest stand statistics of the old-growth as well as new stands have been compared with conventional yield table values for Douglas-fir. Typical trends reflecting site quality are shown. The pattern of forest vegetation that has been used as a key for the separation of biologically equivalent localities among virgin stands of Douglas-fir can also be utilized on cut-over land after logging operations, since the remnant vegetation largely retains its diagnostic value in regard to ecological conditions. However, the moss association loses its original floristic features and is invaded by the more dominant and aggressive elements of the related salal and sword fern associations resulting in a floristic â€œhybrid"" between the two. This may cause difficulties in a site appraisal by purely floristic measures, and the use of the described typical physiographic positions and megascopic edaphic characteristics in combination with the residual vegetation pattern for practical purposes of site identification is recommended. Depending upon the immediate history, whether an area has been logged only, or logged and burnt, the more prevalent remnant vegetation is reduced in relative dominance, but rarely destroyed. Hence, changes among the original vegetation are largely structural rather than compositional. However, considerable compositional changes in the cut-over plant communities as a whole are brought about by the influx of the local weed vegetation, whose relative dominance and masking effect over the residual vegetation is indicative of the kind, degree and time of disturbance as well as of the associations. But, their diagnostic value in regard to ecological criteria is generally low. Therefore, if the two major groups of vegetation that comprise the cut-over plant communities â€” the remnant virgin vegetation and the new weed vegetation â€” are understood as to the relative roles they play in the early secondary succession, the population pattern of the original and more permanent vegetation can still be usefully employed as a guide to the recognition of the various forest associations after they have been logged, with or without subsequent slash burning."</dcvalue>

      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" lang="en">"Only one species, Macrocvatls integrifolia Bory, is present in British Columbia coastal waters. It is found distributed along the whole coast in regions approaching open ocean conditions, but protected against the full ocean force, where the seawater has a specific gravity of over 1.018 at 15 degrees Centigrade and where a suitable rocky bottom, between three feet above to twenty feet below zero tide level, is available.The method of growth of the sporophyte, which is partly dichotomous and partly unilateral, is fully described from the time it is first discernible to the naked eye up to maturity. Dichotomous and subdichotomous divisions of the basal growth region are responsible for the extensive development and perennial habit of the plant.Active zoospore liberation from mature plants and young sporophytes (single, undivided blade stage) were found at least from July 1 to September but the limits were not determined. The gametophytic stages were not followed.Maximum growth (elongation) of Macrocystis recorded was 3.10"" per day for a period of 29 days at the north-east of Vancouver Island. No regeneration from the holdfast or at the cut surfaces of stipes were shown as a result of cutting. Stipes of Macro cystis may continue to grow after being severed from their holdfasts.Plants removed to deeper water are retarded in rate of growth.Various practical aspects of this economically important plant are considered. It is believed two harvests per year are possible if proper precautions are taken with respect to the relative position of the terminal laminae of the plants when harvesting. A method of estimating quantities using the diameter of the stipe as an index is suggested."</dcvalue>

      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" lang="en">In this year of 1948 we see for the first time the economic and political union of several nations of Western Europe. Doubtless they have united in the face of a common danger: communism; but many men of good will hope that this union inspired by fear will survive that fear and become the germ of a true world society.One of these nations, France, has already contributed freely to this idea, the idea of a united Europe. Many of her most eminent contemporary writers have dedicated a considerable portion of the work, a great deal of their thought, to this problem. These French intellectuals of the 1920's and 1930's proposed a variety of ways of accomplishing this vital synthesis, all of their discussions reflecting the new and keen awareness that European civilization has suddenly become extremely mortal. A surprising number of French writers not only realized, well before Munich, that the League of Nations was a house of cards, but sought the catalyst that would permit the nations of Europe, at once the glory and the curse of the world, to fuse otherwise than in the furnace of war.It is the purpose of this thesis to note the views of this subject of several brilliant minds, especially those of Valery, Benda, Larbaud, Durtain and Giraudoux. The examination will be necessarily superficial, but, it is hoped, complete enough to indicate the diversity of opinion and, more important, the unanimity of a very lively concern.</dcvalue>

      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" lang="en">The Squamish River Delta located at the head of Howe Sound, a glacial fjord, in southwestern British Columbia, is being formed by the deposition of sediments carried by the Squamish River and its main tributaries the Cheakamus and Mamquam Rivers. The river system drains an area of 1428 square miles generally underlain by granitic rocks.River flow is seasonal resulting in the intermittent deposition of sediments on the delta front. River training works constructed in 1972 have changed the hydrology of the river and influenced sediment transport and deposition. Channelization has resulted in increased deposition off the mouth of the west channel, and a marine transgression of 'the intertidal zone of the central channel. Hydrologic and oceanographicfactors are the most significant of the natural processes influencing the sedimentary environments of the Delta. Estuarine circulation varies in relation to the dominance of river and tidal currents. Wind conditions are an important factor relating to the wave regime of the delta front.A comparison of bathymetric surveys made in 1930 and 1973 shows the delta front advancing at a rate of 21 feet per year, in the west and central sectors. Erosion is occurring at the head of the Mamquam Submarine Channel on the east flank of the central sector. A seismic profile survey in 1973 recorded the presence of large slump structures on the steep upper slopes of the delta front. These records indicate that the present delta is being built on a series of deformed and unstable sediments. Surficial sediment sampling of the delta front was carried out during and after the freshet of 1973. On the west sector, sands tend to dominate. These are fine to medium grained with large admixtures of silts and clays. The effect of flocculation on the differential settling of the suspended sediment may be an important factor contributing to the presence of clays on the delta front.The effect of port and industrial development on the aquatic ecosystem is currently being studied by research scientists from the Department of the Environment. Land fill and dredging has resulted in the loss of vegetation and benthic algal mats. Habitats of the benthic invertebrates, the primary source of food for juvenile salmon, have been disrupted and are threatened by future development.The need for inter-disciplinary studies combined with a continuing program of data collecting, is necessary to fully understand the factors influencing the formation of the Squamish River Delta and to evaluate the effect of future development.</dcvalue>

      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" lang="en">This dissertation examines Hipparchos, the son of Peisistratos, and the years 528-514 B.C. at Athens. Modern scholarship has generally adjudged Hipparchos a powerless, dissolute aesthete on the basis of Thucydides' test- imonia about Hipparchos' murder. Yet, it is clear from other sources that Hipparchos was much more, perhaps even the most important Peisistratid after Peisistratos' death, certainly the most visible. The purpose of this dissertationis to shed new light on this important period by aiming at a better understanding of Hipparchos.Chapter I concerns Hipparchos' image and is a compilation of testimonia relevant to him. The introduction to the chapter attempts to illustrate the importance of image to Greek tyrants of the archaic period and to show that image can be useful as an indicator of tyrannical power. The remainder of the chapter is divided into the archaeological and literary records of Hipparchos. Sections are devoted to Hipparchos' herms, the wall of the Akademy and his Ptolon dedication. The literary record is divided into external affairs (Hipparchos and Ionia), internal/external affairs (the Onomakritos-affair), and internal affairs (the Panathenaia and Hipparchos). The conclusion is that Hipparchos was far more prominent than his brother Hippias and much more significant than previously believed.Chapter II confronts the historiographical problem of succession to Peisistratos. It is divided into examination of the stele concerning the adikia of the tyrants', Thucydides' most important evidence for the successsion, and the literary tradition about the succession. (An appendix examines the evidence of the sixth century archon-list.) The conclusion is that the succession-issue became controversial in the fifth century, apparently well after the end of the tyranny.Chapter III deals with Thucydides' account of Hipparchos' murder. Sectionsare given to accounts before Thucydides', but later accounts are consideredonly as they differ from his on specific points. Thucydides1 account is examined in two sections: motivation of the tyrannicides and the act itself.The conclusion is that Thucydides was quite probably influenced by his own preconceptions to read his beliefs into a substructure of earlier material.The evidence for this is inconsistency and implausibility in Thucydides' account.An epilogue considers Hipparchos1 influence over later prominent Athenians and the city itself.</dcvalue>

      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" lang="en">This study examines the proposition that among the prehistoric hunter-gatherers of Hesquiat Harbour, west coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia, the geographical area exploited, and hence animal resource selection, was controlled by land use patterns limiting local groups to specific tracts of territory. It suggests that the interaction of the land use system with the environmental diversity of Hesquiat Harbour creates a sub-regional level of resource specialization recognizable in archaeological sites as variation in emphasis on animals from different habitats among the faunal assemblages.A specific proposition, developed from pertinent ethnographic and environmental information, relates land use patterns with a specific patternof diversity among the faunal assemblages from three archaeological sites, DiSo 1, DiSo 9 and DiSo 16. The emphasis on different habitats one would expect to find at each site are predicted. The faunal assemblages, comprising 49,770 skeletal elements and 135,777.4 grams of shell, are described and compared, using relative frequency of skeletal element count and shell weight. The differences and similarities are discussed in relation to sampling and preservation factors, local environmental change, season of exploitation, change through time in material culture and habitats exploited.A statistically significant association of assemblages with different habitat emphases is found to account for the major proportion of the inter-assemblage variation. Observed patterns of habitat emphases are compared with those predicted. Actual emphases in the assemblages of DiSo 16 and DiSo 1 are positively correlated with the predicted patterns, but those of DiSo 9 differ. The differences are consistent with demonstrated local environmental change and a wider territory of exploitation.The analysis suggests that a simple, autonomous local group level of sociopolitical organization was present in Hesquiat Harbour at least 1,200 years ago and demonstrates that the natural environment defined by socio-cultural organizational factors is an important influence on regional faunal assemblage patterning on the Northwest Coast.</dcvalue>

      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" lang="en">The aim of this study was to examine the influence of photoperiodon the hormonal induction of courtship and nest-building behaviour in the male ring dove (Streptopelia risoria). In the first experiment 24 intact males were divided into two groups and held on long (16L:8D) or short (8L:16D) photoregimes for five weeks. They were then paired with intact females and their behaviour recorded. Long day males exhibited significantly higher levels of bowing and nest-soliciting.In the second experiment males were again held on long or short photoperiods. Half of each group received daily injections of testosterone propionate. Testosterone treatment eliminated differencesin courtship between the two groups, but nest-building remained significantly higher in hormone-treated long day birds. The experiment was then repeated using TP-treated castrates. In this case courtship did not vary between long and short groups, although nest-building was still greater under the long photoregime.These results indicate that photoperiod alters male courtshipby stimulating endogenous androgen production. The influence on nest-building, however, appears to be least partially dependent upon some other mechanism.</dcvalue>

      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" lang="en">Current and temperature data were acquired in the source region of the Somali Current, jointly by the Universities of Kiel and Miami, as part of the INDEX pilot studies. The data were acquired over a six-month period (January-July, 1976) which spans the springtime Monsoon reversal. The experiment and the data are described in DÃ¼ing and Schott (1978).This thesis describes the results of the spectrum analysis of fluctuations found in data from the experiment's two southernmost sensor locations. It is found that, once the annual cycle is removed, most of the variance in these current and temperature records resides in subinertial fluctuations. The most prominent spectral feature is a 40- to 50-day peak.This 40- to 50-day period is coincident with that of the global-scale circulation cells found in the tropical atmosphere by Madden and Julian (1971 and 1972). The analysis of wind stress and wind stress curl data for the years 1976 and 1979 presented in this thesis indicate that the 40-to 50-day oscillation was present over the Western Indian Ocean during these years. It is suggested here that wind-forcing excites a long coastally trapped wave. To test this idea, a wind-forced quasi-geostrophic, three-layer model and a reduced-gravity model incorporating lateral mean current shear are applied to the Somali Current regime. Model results suggest that the wind forcing is strong enough to excite the observed current and temperature fluctuations.</dcvalue>

      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" lang="en">The transcriptional control elements of a pair of divergently transcribed C. eleqans heat shock-indueible hsp16 genes were examined by expressing the genes in mouse cells. For this purpose, transfection vectors containing elements necessary for bovine papillomavirus-mediated extrachromosomal replication were constructed. Genes inserted into these vectors could be efficiently transcribed upon introduction into mouse fibroblasts. Elevated copy numbers of these vectors in transfected cells were dependent on expression of BPV gene products in the same cells, but were not dependent on the presence of cis-actinq bovine papillomavirus replication sequences within the vector. The wild-type C. eleqans hsp16 genes were very efficiently transcribed in transfected mouse cells following induction of the heat shock response by high temperature or arsenite treatment. The hspl6 promoter regions contain sequences that closely resemble the regulatory promoter elements of Drosophila heat shock genes. The number and position of these sequence elements was altered in vitro and the modified hsp16 genes were tested for transcriptional competence in mouse cells. A single regulatory element could induce bidirectional transcription of the hsp16 gene pair. Multiple regulatory elements were required for maximal transcription rates. The orientation and configuration of the elements also affected transcription. A mutation in an alternating purine/pyrimidine sequence that is found between the two hspl6 genes had no significant effect on transcription. Splicing of the hsp16 transcripts in transfected mouse cells was either incomplete or occurred at 3' sites that were located 20 to 60 base pairs downstream from the 3' splice site that was used in C. eleqans. The use of downstream 3' splice sites was possibly due to the unusually short length of the hsp16 gene introns. The 3' processing of the hsp16 transcripts was also partially defective.

      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" lang="en">The studies presented in this thesis were designed to establish whether a relationship exists between the uptake of a model toxicant, 1,2,4,5-tetrachlorobenzene (TCB) and the rate of oxygen consumption (MOâ‚‚) in several species of fishes. If so, it is possible that toxicant uptake may be predicted from MOâ‚‚'s measured in the absence of the toxicant.There is no effect of environmental TCB concentrations on the oxygen consumption rate of resting or exercising adult rainbow trout, and body accumulations of the toxicant did not affect the maximal aerobic swimming velocity attained by juvenile rainbow trout. Thus, there is no direct effect of TCB exposure to complicate the relationship between oxygen and toxicant uptake at a variety of swimming velocities.The potential of estimating whole body accumulations of TCB from the toxicant concentration in plasma and 11 tissues was investigated in the anticipation of reducing the work otherwise required to measure whole body concentrations. The variability in TCB concentration of a given tissue, however, is sufficiently great to preclude the use of this method to estimate body burden. Plasma concentrations appear to be indicative of body concentrations following 2 hrs of TCB exposure, however, over longer exposure durations, this is not the case. Thus whole body concentrations can only be obtained through direct measurements.There is a relationship between the rate of oxygen consumption and the uptake rate of 1,2,4,5-tetrachlorobenzene (TCB) during initial toxicant exposure, infive species of fishes forced to swim at different velocities. The animals were exposed to two external TCB concentrations; however, standardizing for the external concentration was not sufficient to permit grouping of the data, likely as a result of an overestimation of the aqueous environmental TCB concentration. Because the data could not be grouped, a single coefficient to predict TCB uptake from MOâ‚‚ could not be calculated. The inclusion of the proportion of body lipid in the relationship describing toxicant uptake markedly improved the coefficient of determination, suggesting that either an elevated body lipid content increases TCB diffusivity at the gill, or that a limitation to the uptake of TCB in addition to that at the gills, may also exist at the level of the tissues.The establishment of the relationship between oxygen and TCB uptake implies a potentiality for the prediction of toxicant uptake in fish, as a function of the animals MOâ‚‚ which can be obtained from the literature. MOâ‚‚ for a variety of fish species, sizes and activity levels, in an assortment of environments have been compiled into a database, called OXYREF (Thurston and Gehrke, 1991). This could be a valuable tool for the prediction of toxicant uptake provided the relationship between toxicant and oxygen uptake is independent of fish size. Physico-chemical characteristics of xenobiotics are well documented and it is conceivable to incorporate a toxicant specific correction factor to predict the uptake of a range of xenobiotics in fish.</dcvalue>

      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" lang="en">Age and growth of the shiner perch, Cymatogaster aggregata Gibbons, were analysed with the aid of scales taken from fish obtained at Keates Island, British Columbia, in 1963 and 1964. Cymatogaster exhibits a relatively constant relationship between scale growth and increment of body length throughout its life and based on this observation a new method of back-calculation was developed. The scales of Cymatogaster may have up to three different types of checks, birth checks or metamorphic annuli, spawning checks, and annuli. The highest levels of instantaneous growth rates occurred during the spring and early summer, between the time of formation of an annulus and the following spawning check. It is during this period that water temperatures reach a maximum and food is most abundant. The lowest instantaneous growth rates occurred during the fall and winter months between the formation of a spawning check and the following annulus.Seasonal and diurnal movement patterns exhibited by Cymatogaster were studied by means of extensive gill net sets in 1963 and 1964 at the Keates Island study area. The fish first moved into the area in early June and left again by mid-October. In June, just prior to spawning, Cymatogaster exhibited a pattern of diurnal movement that involved migration from deep to shallow water during the day, and from shallow to deeper water at night. After the spawning period there was a complete reversal of the diurnal movement pattern. Light intensity appeared to be the most important factor governing the onshore and offshore movements of Cymatogaster.Stomach content analysis indicated that by volume, mussels and algae were the most important items in the diet of Cymatogaster, although barnacles and zooplankton were sometimes eaten in large quantities. Yearling Cymatogaster fed actively throughout the time they were present in the study area but mature fish exhibited a marked reduction of feeding during the spawning period. The initiation of feeding was governed primarily by an increase in light intensity associated with sunrise, and little or no feeding occurred during the hours of darkness. Data indicated that the rate of passage of food through the digestive tract varied between adults and yearlings, as well as seasonally.The relationships between age and growth, seasonal and diurnal movement patterns, and feeding habits and food preferences of Cymatogaster were correlated and related to factors of the physical and biotic environment.</dcvalue>

      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" lang="en">"'""Transcolonial Circuits': Historical Fiction and National Identities in Ireland, Scotland,and Canada"" explores the intersections between gender, canon-formation, and literarygenre in order to argue that English- and French-Canadian historical fiction wasinfluenced, both in form and content, by the precedent-setting fictions o f Scotland andIreland in the early nineteenth century. Conceived in the spirit o f Katie Trumpener'sBardic Nationalism: The Romantic Novel and the British Empire (1997), this dissertationextends Trumpener's examination of nineteenth-century British and Canadian romanticfiction by exploring in greater detail the flow of ideas and literary techniques betweenIreland, Scotland, and English and French Canada. It does so in order to revise criticalunderstandings of the formal and thematic origins and development of Canadianhistorical fiction from the nineteenth century to the present.Chapter One functions as a series of literary snapshots that examine historicallythe critical and popular reception of novels by Maria Edgeworth and Sydney Owenson inIreland, Sir Walter Scott in Scotland, John Richardson, William Kirby, and JeanMcllwraith in English Canada, and Philippe Aubert de Gaspe and Napoleon Bourassa inFrench Canada. I pay particular attention to the issues o f gender and political ideology asinseparable from the history of the novel itself. In Chapter Two, by focussing on thetravel trope, I examine in detail how Irish, Scottish, and Canadian writers transformed theinvestigative journeys of Samuel Johnson and Arthur Young into journeys of resistanceto the dictates of the metropolis. Chapter Three focuses on the complications of marriageas a metaphor o f intercultural union. It pays particular attention to the intersectionsbetween gender, sexuality, and colonial identity. The Conclusion extends the concernsraised in the thesis about the relationship between historical writing and national identityto the late-twentieth-century Canadian context, by examining the adaptation of literaryand historiographical conventions to the medium of television in the CBC/SRC televisionseries Canada: A People's History, which aired in 2001-02."</dcvalue>

      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" lang="en">Dielectric resonances in the microwave region 16 to 40 GHz have been observed in single crystals of the highly anisotropic material TTF-TCNQ below 25Â°K. The application of open-circuit boundary conditions to the dielectric resonator problem is shown to be inappropriate for this material and a tractable alternative theory, which takes external fields into account, is presented. Using this theory, the dielectric modes were analyzed at 4.2Â°K to obtain the complex dielectric constant Îµb along the crystallographic b-axis. For four samples studied in detail, the average values for the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant are found to be 4200 and 16 respectively at 25 GHz. A frequency dependence of Îµâ€™bis found; however, it is not clear whether this frequency dependence is intrinsic to the samples or is due to the approximate nature of the solution. No frequency dependence of Îµâ€&#x9d;b was observed.</dcvalue>

      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" lang="en">The rapid urbanization of land and the associated growth of the 'city' have created an unprecedented demand for living and work space throughout this country and the world. The problems that are arising from this process should be examined.Sign proliferation is one of the factors contributing towards the overall effect on the character of the city. The main controversies have centred around sign appearance and location based on their presumed ugliness and effect on their surroundings. Private advertising zeal, or misplaced public priorities are often the cause of these physical problems, which lead to public and private conflicts of interest.The basic aim of the thesis is to examine sign regulation in order to determine its effect on the urban environment, as well as analyse the problems of physical appearance, public and private interests and other resulting problems of regulation.The basic assumptions taken for the study are: it is desirable for man to seek and demand an environment which will contribute towards his well-being; the concept of the public interest is both valid and useful; and planning in the form of sign regulation is useful and possible in our society, with some optimum is possible. As a basis for this investigation it is hypothesized that - The aesthetic purpose of sign regulation results in a conflict of public and private interests, that is being resolved by the adoption of diverse municipal sign regulations.-With the assumptions in mind, the investigation comprised a review of the literature, which was most useful for the establishment of techniques and general requirements for an effective environment, as well as information from a questionnaire directed to several cities in Canada which have undertaken sign regulatory measures with the ensuing problems. The hypothesis is examined specifically through the use of sign legislation of several cities and municipalities in British Columbia.The City of Victoria B.C., one of the cities studied, exhibited many of the typical problems encountered when stricter control over signs is attempted. The process of adopting sign regulation, amidst public and private interests, is aptly illustrated by this example. Another City, Ottawa, Ontario, displayed many of the same problems. Here, sign regulation, as one of the ingredients of a beautification scheme, contributed much to the pedestrian atmosphere and urban environment, as well as showing the relation of improved sign regulation to an overall program of environmental improvement. The most significant observation in the study was the variation in contents of sign ordinances. The many types of regulations presently in use, leads to the conclusion that sign regulation today is complex, with many problems still unsolved. Sign control applied by local government presently could be any level that is achieved in light of the ensuing problems within the community.The basic recommendations are that local government and private interests collaborate to achieve the desired objective. Although this joint effort may lead to diverse regulations, the ultimate goal should be controlling the direction of the developing environment. This can be obtained in part by controlling and regulating signs. Local government, through its delegated power to control street furnishings in the public right-of-way should provide the atmosphere and leadership necessary so that private enterprise may from time to time initiate actions for urban improvement. Subject to the limitations placed on the study, the hypothesis is considered valid.</dcvalue>

      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" lang="en">This thesis is a study of the Frankish psalmody of the early medieval period. The most important source of this practice in existence today is the tenth-century treatise, the Commemoratio Brevis de Tonis et Psalmis Modulandis. During the last fifty years there have been several attempts by musicologists to come to terms with the evidence of this source but these, unfortunately, were based on a faulty eighteenth-century edition of an incomplete manuscript. The present study, however, is based on a new edition of the only complete source: the Wolfenbuttel Ms.Gud. lat. 2Â°  72 (4376).The method has been to reconstruct the evidence of this treatiseâ€”the musical examples of psalm tones and the commentary of the textâ€”and to compare it to the standard practice of the late Middle Ages. Errors perpetuated unwittingly by the eighteenth-century edition have been corrected. The introduction summarizes the methods and origins of psalmody; the role of the Franks in the formation of the Gregorian repertoire; the subsequent decay and reform of the chant; and the role of the psalms in the liturgy. The first four chapters consider the many inflections of the psalm tone individually:the first intonation, the termination, the tenor and the mediant melody. The final chapter is devoted to a study of the special tones which were probably the remains of a practice even earlier than that of the tenth century.The Gregorian psalm tones appear at first sight to be sterile ground for historical investigationâ€”almost featureless in their simplicity. Closer inspection reveals, however, a number of discernable strata belonging to quite different epochs.The earliest portion of the psalm tone is the tenor. There can be little argument that the most primitive usage involved the recitation of liturgical texts on a single pitch (hardly a musical phenomenon, more properly described as a method of public address). The next stage involvedâ€”for the purpose of articulating the verses of psalmsâ€”the affixing of intonations and terminations. In the earliest epoch, before the Carolingian reforms, it would seem that a psalmody of intonations, tenors and terminations was not yet formed into a coherent system. It is generally believed that the system of the eight modes was itself only introduced into the West at the time of the great Emperor. It would be difficult therefore to argue that the practice prior to this introduction had any connection with the eight-mode system. It would seem, rather, that local usages involving many patterns, some of them made venerable by great antiquity, were in force.The next stage in the evolution was to provide a correlation between the new system of the octoÃ«chos and the psalmody. At this point most of the older free practice was abandoned. Some remnants, however, have remainedâ€”we have suggested that this is an explanation for the special tones in the Commemoratio Brevis--either owing to the force of tradition or the difficulty of making indisputable modal assignments.The attitude to the text of the psalm did not remain unchanged throughout this long period of evolution. In the earliest period the text accent was treated quite casually, as an examination of the intonations and the terminations shows clearly. At a later stage, however,--and here the mediant portions of the psalms with their quite different attitude toward text accent are instructiveâ€”the musicians approached the problem quite differently, taking extraordinary care that the correct inflections of the words were projected. It is tempting to associate this new approach, which reminds one so much of the Renaissance, with the well known Carolingian rebirth of knowledge.The history of the psalm tones subsequent to the Commemoratio Brevis is one of progressive refinement: a reduction to a practice both supple and logical, the last stage of which is represented by the Vatican Edition of 1908.</dcvalue>

      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" lang="en">"Ronald Dworkin has achieved prominence in the field of jurisprudence through his book, Taking Rights Seriously, (hereafter TRS) his many articles in the ""New York Review of Books,"" and other publications that pursue a coherent philosophy for liberals. In response to criticism of his earlier work, Dworkin has expanded and clarified his liberal position on equality rights. This thesis will address how Dworkin's later writings attempt to fill in gaps that occur in Dworkin's first arguments for a hierarchical, principled picture of the law. It will be argued here that Dworkin's views require an unusual perspective on the concept of an individual, and this renders his rights-based political morality seriously deficient.The nature of Dworkin's theory is first indicated by an attack on the ""ruling theory of law"" which he characterizes as positivistic when asked what the law is, and utilitarian when required to decide what the law should be. His central criticism charges that legal arguments are incomplete without principles which refer to or are implications of rights. Dworkin's liberal political morality is founded on rights to equal respect and concern. The elaboration of what these rights mean is sustained throughout Dworkin's publications. He maintains that his liberal rights-thesis is the theoretical articulation of the constitutional right to equality. Applying Dworkin's rights-theory to the Regents of the University of California v. Bakke2 case illuminates many of the more abstract aspects of his views. This thesis will argue against Dworkin by focusing on the too-narrow conception of individuals implied by his theory of rights. The ideal Dworkin employs of a right to 'equality of resources' justifies an aggressive redistributional scheme, unchecked by a fuller conception of what is an individual. Dworkin is only able to hold his ideal of a right to 'equality of resources' together with his notion of individual rights by accepting a diminished concept of the individual. This argument suggests that a fuller conception of an individual recognizes the connection between merit and entitlement. Dworkin's scepticism regarding the feasibility of merit being protected by individual rights is undercut by introducing a distinction between merit and success. Leaving key aspects of an individual, such as merit and its related features, out of official deliberation about rights, conceptually inhibits the extent of individualizability in a rights theory. If we wish to maintain such features, and value their protection and cultivation by a political order, adopting Dworkin's rights-thesis and its consequences is impossible."</dcvalue>

      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" lang="en">Interest in the role that local people's knowledge and experiences can play in naturalresource conservation is increasing throughout the world. This is due in part becauseprotected areas and national parks have repeatedly proven to be unsuccessful inachieving conservation objectives, and in part because they threaten the existence ofnearby rural communities. When severe restrictions are placed on access to the forestresources local people depend upon for survival, poverty is often exacerbated. Theresult is that local people feel contempt and distrust for the protected area.In order to mitigate the impacts that protected areas have had on rural populations, localpeople have become the locus for development activities which either strive tounderstand the value of local ecological knowledge and experiences, or whichencourage local people to participate in often externally-designed initiatives. Only acommunity-based natural resource management (CBNRM) approach, which is groundedin an understanding of local people's realities and livelihood needs, can unite thestrengths of local knowledge and participation.To gain insight into the opportunities and constraints facing planners seeking to take aparticipatory approach to park management, a case study was conducted of Cat BaNational Park, Vietnam. Semi-structured interviews were carried out in two communitieswithin the park, Khe Sau Hamlet and Viet Hai Village. The results show that local peoplein Cat Ba are willing and able to participate in the park's conservation activities, but thatthey are inhibited from doing so by political and socio-economic factors. As well, it wasfound that local people possess detailed ecological knowledge about the park's forestresources. This knowledge has been developed by keen observations of thesurrounding environment for generations. Improving local livelihoods was identified bylocal people as essential to reducing their dependence on forest biodiversity.Drawing on ideas offered by Cat Ba interviewees and analysis of other findings from thecase study, suggestions are offered for capturing opportunities and overcoming barriersto effective participatory park management.</dcvalue>

      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" lang="en">A histological investigation was carried out on the esophagus and stomach of the following birds: kingfisher (Megacercyle alcyon caurina), California murre (Uria aalgae Californioa), screeoh owl (Otus asio kennicotti),Peale's faloon (Falco peregrinius pealei),  and sparrow hawk (Falco sparverius sparverius). A number of stains was used to intensify the different structures present. In the kingfisher, murre and owl the esophagus was a thin walled highly expansible tube of generally even calibre, whereas in the Peak's falcon the anterior part was dilated into a sac. The wall of the esophagus possessed the usual structure characteristic of this region of the digestive tube. Three types of glands have been distinguished in these birds. In the kingfisher and owl simple oval glands were situated almost entirely within the epithelium. The glands and excretory duct were composed of similar cells with slight variations occuring in excretory duct lengths. In the California murre the glands were still simple but had sunken to the tunica propria with just the excretory ducts passing through the epithelium. The gland cells were narrower, and the duct cells resembled those observed in the owl and the kingfisher. These glands were all apocrine secretory. However, in the Pealeâ€™s falcon and sparrow hawk secretion was holocrine. These glands were deeply embedded within the tunica propria and resembled the esophageal glands of the chicken. The excretory ducts were lined by squamous epithial cells. Although the birds examined possessed a variety of food habits: fish, mammals, birds and crustaceans, the food was essentially meat. However, considerable variations in the structure of the esophagus were observed.The proventriculus was comprised of: a mucosa, indented with minute gastric pits, a muscularis externa of three layers of smooth muscle, and a lamina adventitia that surrounded the entire tube. Within the mucosa the deep glands were situated. These were composed of large lobes, enveloped in a dense capsule of connective tissue and internally consisted of simple tubules that radiated about a central excretory duct. The structure of the proventriculus was more or less uniform in the birds investigated, with only slight variations occuring in cellular arrangement and cellular size.The gizzards in the birds examined were large spherical structures that filled a majority of the abdominal cavity. In the kingfisher, owl, Peale's falcon, and sparrow hawk, the gizzard was lined by a thin keratinoid lining that was secreted by the glands present in the gizzard mucosa. The muscularis externa was of approximately equal thickness throughout. In the murre, the keratinoid layer was five or six times as thick as in the above birds and the muscles showed a heavy development on the dorsal and ventral sides. This development took place toward a grinding mechanism that was necessary for processing the hard shelled crustaceans eaten by this bird.</dcvalue>

      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" lang="en">This was a descriptive study of the agreements reached by learningassistants and classroom teachers when identifying a student's problem(s) duringa consultative problem identification interview. The behavioral consultationresearch literature suggested that problem identification was a critical componentof the problem solving process (Bergan &amp; Tombari, 1976) however, the reliabilityof information gathered during the consultation interviews required furtherinvestigation (White &amp; Edelstein, 1991). This study addressed the issue ofreliability of the problem identification interview in consultation by examininginterrater and interparticipant agreements as to the priority, nature and numberof problems identified during the interview.Nine learning assistance teachers conducted problem identificationinterviews with each of four classroom teachers from their individual schoolsregarding students who the teacher identified as difficult to teach. Participantsrated their problem identification interviews with an evaluative rating scale ofinterview helpfulness, and levels of problem identification and sharedunderstanding in their interview dyad. Post consultation interviews with eachparticipant revealed the levels to which each identified the presenting problemsi n priority by nature and number. Results reported the level to which eachinterview dyad (N=36) agreed upon the problem(s) identified. Two raters gaveindependent ratings to the level of shared understanding of the problem(s)identified by the participants as well as to the priority, number and nature of theproblem(s). Participant-rater agreements were determined for the samevariables.The results reported a moderate level of agreement (Kappa=.66)between the participants as to the nature of the highest priority problem. Amoderate level of agreement was determined between Rater 2 and the learningassistance teachers (K=.67) and the classroom teachers (K=.78) regarding thenature of the highest priority problem as well.The implication of these findings suggested that the dynamic process ofproblem identification is reliable. However, the process may result in lack ofcomplete agreement between participants until the process results in problemdescriptions which are specific enough to allow problem solution to beattempted. A replication of this study is needed to further validate these results.Further research is warranted in order to confirm the level at which problemidentification is completed.</dcvalue>

      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" lang="en">"This study examines the concept ""jealousy"" using a combination of empirical and phenomenological approaches. In the empirical phase objective data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. In the phenomenological phase subjective data were analyzed on the basis of major descriptors, elements and themes in the verbatim responses. Interpretations in each phase were supported by data and findings from the other phase and by the conceptual understandings gained from a review of three theories of emotion and a critique of literature on jealousy from several disciplines.Three hundred adults from a student family housing complex were surveyed using an adapted version of a jealousy inventory by Aronson and Pines (1982). Forty-five female and 28 male respondents defined jealousy in their own words; described and interpreted their most extreme experiences with the emotion and responded (on a one-to-seven scale) to objective item subtests of jealousy prevalence; physical and emotional reactions; general reactions and coping mechanisms.Quantitative and qualitative analyses resulted in many preliminary findings. Among them were: apparent therapeutic effects of the instrument; sex differences in each of the objective subtests; and qualitative similarities and differences among individuals and between the sexes in participants' definitions, experiential accounts and interpretations.Several hypotheses were generated and many suggestions for future research were discussed. Implications for counselling practice generally promoted application of a broader conceptualization and more positive outcomes for jealousy experiences."</dcvalue>

      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" lang="en">"A new method is presented for rapid differentiation between coniferous woods commonly found in mixtures in major lumber producing regions of British Columbia. The species mixtures differentiated are the group known as ""spruce/ pine/ fir"" (SPF) containing white spruce (Picea glauca Voss), lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl.) and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa Nutt.); the pair western larch (Larix occidentalis Nutt.) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii Franco.); and the group of western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla Sarg.), Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis Carr.) and amabilis fir (Abies amabilis Dougl.).The method entailed measuring the reflectance infrared spectrum of a sample set of small wood pieces at a resolution of two wave numbers, determining which wavelengths were useful for differentiating species through a combination of correlation analyses and principal component analyses and using measurements at these wavelengths to develop species models using discriminant analysis. These models were then used to classify a larger set of samples measured under the same conditions. This approach was used to classify both green wood samples and the same samples after freeze-drying.For the SPF group the most effective overall classification model for the dry samples used 30 wavelengths and correctly classified 76% of samples, including 74% of heartwood samples and 89% of sapwood samples. For the green samples, the most effective sort used 10 wavelengths and correctly assigned species to 83% of green samples representing 84% of heartwood samples and 76% of sapwood samples.Classification was unsuccessful when the same classification parameters were applied to a matched set of extractive-free SPF samples, indicating that the sorting criteria are dependant upon the presence of extractive chemicals, both in heartwood and sapwood.The same classification parameters applied to a SPF mixture from eastern Canada (black spruce (Picea mariana B.S.P.), white spruce (Picea qlauca Voss.), jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.), red pine (Pinus resinosa Ait.), white pine (Pinus strobus L.) and balsam fir (Abies balsamea Hill) were less successful than for the western SPF mixture. This suggests that each species may have unique sorting criteria based upon the somewhat different extractive chemical complex present in its wood.For the western larch/ Douglas-fir, the most effective overall classification model used 18 wavelengths and classified 98% of dry samples correctly for both heartwood and sapwood. For green samples, the best sort used 12 wavelengths and correctly assigned species to 91% of green samples, representing 90% of heartwood samples and 91% of sapwood samples.For the western hemlock/ Sitka spruce/ amabilis fir mixture, the most effective sort for the dry samples correctly classified 83% of the samples, 85% of heartwood samples and 56% of sapwood samples. Classification of the green samples proved difficult, with the best sort only 67% correct and using 15 wavelengths. However, if only western hemlock and Sitka spruce were sorted, the effectiveness rose to 82%."</dcvalue>

      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" lang="en">The aim of this thesis is to study the problem of change in Jewish religious life. At the outset, a brief historical review of the development of Jewish religious law is sketched In order to introduce the reader to some of the religious problems which have faced the Jews during the past two centuries.  The second chapter outlines the four most important modern approaches to the problem of change: Reform, Neo-Orthodox, Conservative, and Reconstructionist. In connection with each of these movements, the reader will find a brief history, explanation of principles, and evaluation.  A study of Jewish religious life in Vancouver is presented in the third chapter to show the extent of social change away from the norm of Orthodoxy that has taken place in the Jewish religious life of this community. Wherever possible, comparisons are made with the Jewish community of Minneapolis, one of the few that have been studied, in order to ascertain if Vancouver is typical.  In the last chapter certain conclusions are reached about the need for change in Jewish religious life. Conclusions are reached after considering the history of Jewish religious law, the modern attempts to change this law, and the extent to which contemporary Jews observe Jewish religious law.</dcvalue>

      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" lang="en">This study consisted in part of general observations of the biology of four species of waterstrider (Gerris buenoi, incurvatus, notabilis, and remiges), in Marion Lake, B.C, and in part of an experimental manipulation of density and food supply in replicated populations of penned G. notabilis. Gerrids have a generation time of one year; adults overwinter, lay their eggs in the spring, and then die; nymphs become adults in about two months. In the natural population storms and food shortage probably caused the greatest mortality. In the penned populations survival of nymphs was inversely proportional to spring density of adults, and directly proportional to food supply. In low density pens fewer nymphs hatched but relatively more survived; in high density pens more nymphs hatched but relatively fewer survived; thus fall numbers were much the same (within food treatments) regardless of initial density.Increased density also lowered survival of adults in both food treatments, and, in turn, low adult survival enhanced the expectation of survival of nymphs, in the unfed pens only. However these effects were unimportant compared with the direct effects of density and food on nymph survival.Most of the nymphs died during the first stadium, probably owing to cannibalism by older nymphs and parents in the fed pens, and to both starvation and cannibalism in the unfed pens. In view of the fluctuating food supply to which gerrids are subject, their opportunistic method of feeding and concomitant cannibalistic behaviour is probably of selective advantage to the individual, as well as being a potential population regulating mechanism.</dcvalue>

      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" lang="en">In this thesis an attempt is made to shew that moral responsibility -- that a man merits praise or blame as he acts well or badly -- is compatible with the idea of an omnipotent God and a causal determinism. Moreover, a man's responsibility for his acts depends on their being his acts; i.e. he has a will, is free to choose, and acts voluntarily.Chapter one sets forth what the writer considers the best definitions of causality, chance, volition, freedom, determinism, indeterminism and necessity, Aristotle's systematic philosophy seeming the most practicable. The Christian concepts of will and predestination receive their first explanation in Saint Augustine. In the succeeding chapters the historical approach is used to set forth the attitudes of various philosophers to the problems Involved. The belief appears widespread that freedom (which is essential if one is to have responsibility) is incompatible with determinism; yet Aristotle and Spinoza shew that such is not the case. Indeterminism, rather than permitting freedom, makes it impossible, for then, man becomes subject to chance. The majority of the philosophies examined shew inconsistencies with a systematic theology and, although certain truths may be found in each, are rejected as being either unfruitful or incapable of being developed in the direction intended.The writer concludes that the most consistent and fruitful interpretation of moral responsibility Is given by Aristotle and Saint Thomas Aquinas. Aristotle gives us a consistent philosophical system which Saint Thomas interprets in the light of Christian doctrine, and it is this philosophy which seems best to correlate with Catholic teaching. For Saint Thomas, that the will is free and human acts voluntary does not conflict with the idea of a divine, omnipotent Being; and necessity, providence and predestination do not conflict with free will in man. Both chance and determinism make freedom in man possible, more especially as man has intellect and reason to deliberate on courses of action. As all acts of the will are voluntary, man may be, and is, commended or censured for his acts as they are good or bad. He has choice, and this choice is free, so that the outcome of his actions is his own responsibility. As this view, despite its many difficulties, appears to be the most complete, it seems to be the best one on which to build in the future.</dcvalue>

      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" lang="en">"This study proposed an alternative method of scoring theTorrance Test of Creative Thinking: Thinking Creatively with Words(TTCT: Verbal A). This scoring method was compared to theconventional scoring method. I first considered the current methodof scoring, ""the old method"" and then proposed a ""new method"".The old and the new methods of scoring were compared on asubscale of the TTCT. Both the old and the new methods of scoringwere then compared to the Canadian Test of Basic Skills (CTBS) totallanguage scores to determine if a relationship existed between verbalacademic achievement versus the creativity construct.The new scoring method of creativity showed an improvementover the old method of scoring on the TTCT: Verbal A subtest. Thereliability coefficient, for internal consistency, declined from 0.83 to0.54. This decline was interpreted as an improvement because theinitial value of 0.83 was artificially high. This was due, to a very highintercorrelation between fluency and originality (inter-attributecorrelation value =. 97). The new scoring method corrected thisinflation.I found a veiy low, negative correlation between CTBS totallanguage and both the old and the new methods of scoring forcreativity. The correlation coefficients were -.18, and -.17,respectively. This low value negative correlation demonstrated thatcreativity was not connected to verbal academic achievement.Although divergent thinking is the most commonly used aspectof creative thinking, previous researchers (e.g., Runco, 1986) havesuggested that the tests of creativity lack reliability. The issue ofreliability of a test score has generally been defined in terms ofvariation of scores obtained by the individual on successiveindependent testing (Cronbach, 1947). Neither the assumption ofconstancy of true scores nor the assumptions of experimentalindependence can be realized in practice with most psychologicalvariables. Therefore, the composite reliability of a test needs to beconsidered as a concept, which can not be directly measured.Torrance (1986) specifically discouraged the use of composite testscores and instead recommended interpretation of the subscalescores in relation to one another. The fundamental problem currentlyfaced with the TTCT is that scores derived from the same responsedata cause potentially spuriously subscale correlation. This inflatesthe reliability coefficient and seriously jeopardizes score consistencyand reliability.Thorndike (1972) has argued that fluency, flexibility, andoriginality scores tended to be highly correlated, since all areaccumulated over the same set of responses given by theexaminees. This seriously discounts the value of the old scoringformula recommended by the Technical Scoring Formula of theTTCT. This fundamental problem of scoring has been attributed toderivation of five separate scores in that the scores were derivedfrom the same response data (Heasusler &amp; Thompson, 1988).This type of score derivation introduced spuriously high scalecorrelation because the flexibility, fluency, and originality scorestended to be highly correlated.Through some corrective procedures, correcting fluency, Clarkand Mirels (1970) recommended that correlation coefficient valuefrom several measures of Torrance's Test of Creative Thinking(Figure Completion) would decrease. This procedure consisted ofadministering a revised form of the sub-test to 93 students. Thesewere then scored, based on fluency, flexibility, originality, andelaboration. Corrected fluency scores led to lower reliabilitycoefficient values. My study had a similar experience. The alphacoefficient value dropped to .54 from .83, with the new scoringmethod.My research dealt with the score inflation, with the old scoringmethod, scoring inconsistency, and, proposed a new method ofscoring the TTCT. I also highlighted the issue of inter-attribute highcorrelation between fluency and originality attributes. These twoattributes are the main ingredients in assessing creativity.My research focused on the three traits of creativity, namely:(1) the fluency, (2) the originality, (3) the flexibility. These weremeasured with the use of the TTCT: Verbal A: Activity 4: ProductImprovement. The TTCT was administered to a sample of children(N=187) in grades4 to 8. The data was analyzed to assess scorereliability. The existing CTBS total language scores available at theschool were also utilized in order to consider any relationshipbetween creativity and verbal academic achievement.The new scoring method enhanced the reliability coefficientand improved upon the scoring techniques. The new scoringapproach adopted the same scoring techniques as the old method'with the measurement of fluency and flexibility attributes. However,with the measurement of originality attribute, a new approach wasadopted. The new scoring method I have designed considered onlythe two score attributes; fluency and flexibility. The originality score,which is simply a ""fall-out"" from the fluency score, was not included.This exclusion avoided double counting between fluency andoriginality and dealt with the high correlation problem between thesetwo attributes. With the old scoring method, the correlation betweenfluency and originality would be as high as .99 (Thorndike, 1972).This simply indicated that fluency and originality attributes weremeasuring the same creativity dimension. The new method ofscoring rectified this problem.Hocevar (1979) recommended a method as a way of improvingtest reliability. Hocevar's method, however, recommended scoring fororiginality and flexibility and dividing the resulting score by the totalnumber of responses. His recommendation was very valid inimproving discriminant validity and did not address the score inflationand high inter-attribute correlation problem between fluency and,originality. I have somewhat revised his recommended method andproposed that e capture the flexibility and fluency responses anddivide the resulting score by the total number of responses. Thisensured consistency in measurement and corrected the high inter-correlationproblem between the TTCT attributes. It also improvedscore reliability.Under the new method of scoring, each response for flexibilityand fluency is adjusted by dividing the resulting scores by the totalnumber of responses. Since fluency scores tended to be highlycorrelated with the originality scores, this new approach safeguardedagainst duplication in scoring also reduced spurious correlationbetween fluency and originality. Originality attribute was no longerrequired for scoring. Division of both flexibility and fluency by thetotal number of responses also streamlined the overall compositescore.The composite score of the TTCT, under the new methodcontained fluency and flexibility scores. This also ensured that anumber of response which would normally be scored with ""0"",would be considered as part of the fluency score, as originalityattribute was no longer considered.The factor analytic results obtained by Heauslar and Thompson(1988) showed that the TTCT subscale yielded discrete scores. Thegeneral creativity factors were sufficient in assessing creativebehavior. These factors included fluency, flexibility and originality.The total TTCT scores were not recommended (Torrance, 1974;Torrance &amp; Ball, 1984) for assessment of creativity. Herecommended using scores of fluency, flexibility and originality. Thisalso jeopardized the integrity of the total creativity scores.The new method improved the reliability of the test scores ofWe TTCT by enhancing the existing scoring methodology. With theold scoring approach of originality, responses which did not meet thepre-determined fluency categories, were scored a ""0"", regardless ofthe relevancy of response. This diluted the originality scored, anddistorted score reliability. The new method considered all the fluencyresponses and scrutinized all response for consistency under fluencycategory. Fluency attribute was not simply considered as the numberof total ideas, regardless of the degree of relevancy of task on hand.Each response of fluency was evaluated for its relevancy, in view ofthe task, on hand. This streamlined the scoring approach withfluency.With the new method of scoring, the standardized alphacoefficient declined from .83 to .54. The new method of scoringimproved the process and made it easy and more relevant to scorefor fluency and flexibility. A very low, negative linear relationship wasfound between the creativity construct and academic achievement,as represented CTBS total language test."</dcvalue>

      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" lang="en">Studies of the impact of abuse on children's cognitive and school performance have focused largely on maltreated and neglected children. In this study the academic performance of 15 sexually abused children was compared to the academic performance of 15 non-abused children that were matched on gender and grade. The permanent record cards of all the children involved were analyzed using descriptive statistics. T-test revealed that the sexually abused children performed significantly poorer than the non-abused children. Results indicating that the sexually abused group did not appear to differ academically prior to the abuse suggest that the differences between the two groups may be, in part, due to the sexual abuse. Variables surrounding the sexual abuse did not appear to affect academic performance, nor did gender play a significant role in academic performance.</dcvalue>

      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" lang="en">ProblemThis thesis attempts to determine if the Canadian federaland provincial governments are increasing their assertion of the public interest in the collective bargaining process. The primary concern is to determine to what extent the government,through its new labour legislation will be able to affect the quality of collective agreements. The quality of collective agreements can be affected directly through arbitration or can be affected indirectly by influencing the power positions of the negotiating parties.Method of InvestigationThe first problem which is tackled is the definition of the public interest. The public interest is a term now being used in labour legislation, for which a precise definition is not easily derived. A literature analysis is undertaken to develop a conceptual framework of the public interest.Since this is an investigation of the changing role of the government, it is necessary to establish the traditional role of the government in the collective bargaining process. This is accomplished by examining less recent government legislationas well as case studies of the applications of the U.S. Taft-Hartley Act.The public employees of Canada and the United States are treated as a special case. Recent legislative developments inboth countries have resulted in federal public servants to becomeactive in collective bargaining. These recent developmentsconsist in Canada of the Public Service Staff Relations Act, and in the United States of the Executive Order 10899.The new developments in provincial labour legislation consist of B.C.â€™s Bill 33, Saskatchewanâ€™s  Essential Services Emergency Act, and Ontario's Rand Royal Commission Report. These two Acts and the Royal Commission Report are analyzed critically for their potential effect upon the collective bargainingprocess.ConclusionsThe literature analysis of the public interest reveals that there is no universally acceptable definition of the public interest. The public interest can only be meaningfully used within a situational framework. In other words, the concept is capable of definition only within a specific situation. Despite the fact that the concept is not likely ever to be universally defined, it will undoubtedly continue to be widely used.The policy of the Canadian federal and provincial governments regarding collective bargaining has traditionally been to assist the parties to come to an agreement. The role of the government has not been one of interference. It has consisted solely of facilitating agreements by postponing work stoppages and by providing mediators. Although the effectiveness of these measures can be questioned, the intent is quite clear.The recent provincial legislation seems to reinforce the proposition that the strike is an undesirable form of social conflict. It is felt to be undesirable in the sense that the legislation encourages the parties to collective negotiations to settle their dispute without resorting to work stoppages. At the same time, it recognizes that the threat of a work stoppageis part of the collective bargaining process.The new legislation formalizes the concept that there are certain kinds of collective bargaining relationships which are heavily endowed with the public interest. Whereas governmentactivity in these kinds of disputes had occurred on an ad hoc basis in the past, the Rand Report, B.C.'s Bill 33, and the Saskatchewan legislation established mechanisms which will providefor the assertion of the public interest in extraordinary labour disputes. In some cases, and where the parties cannot come to an agreement without resorting to a work stoppage, the new legislation will provide an agency or mechanism through which the government can submit the dispute to compulsory arbitration.</dcvalue>

      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" lang="en">This study is designed to identify and describe child study centres operated by Canadian degree-granting institutions in 1978. The implications of the results are relevant to the efforts of those who are engaged in studying young children, those who are applying knowledge to the development of programs and practices and those who are providing guidance to parents and workers who interact with children day-to-day. Child study centres were identified by an enquiry mailed to administrators in the fifty degree-granting institutions in Canada. Twenty institutions were found to operate child study centres as defined for this investigation. Information describing the child study centres was gathered by means of a survey questionnaire mailed to each of the twenty persons named by their administrator. This included basic descriptions of the centres and information about aspects of the children's programs, faculty responsibility for and involvement with the centres, relative importance of the functions performed by the centres, policy making, supports and comment on the centres' impact on their communities. The study shows that more than two thirds of the child study centres have been established within the past ten years, confirmation of suggestions in the literature that child study has mushroomed in recent years. Most centres operate programs for preschool children, placing them in the tradition of laboratory preschools. Most are engaged in the preparation of teachers, whether they are under the auspices of a faculty of education or some other faculty or department. All, however, place emphasis on at least two of the four main functional areas examined: research, teacher preparation, dissemination of child-related knowledge, and service. More than one-third of centres do not have sufficient financial support to carry out present goals. Respondents from most centres express a desire to communicate with other centres across Canada, naming topics of common concern. Listed in the study is a catalogue of child study centres, many of which had been invisible in the literature. Such a list can enable communication to take place among them. Further investigation will be required to examine the extensive involvement with child study and children's programs taking place on Canadian campuses and whether the effectiveness of new knowledge is being tested by its application to children in typical life situations. It is suggested that diverse sources of funding and communication and cooperation among centres will be required if the potential of child study centres as powerful resources for the translation of knowledge into practice is to be achieved.</dcvalue>

      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" lang="en">On the Gracey group of claims, Unuk River, B.C., are mesothermal-type quartz veins; (1) with speoularite-gold mineralization, (2) with galena-pyrite-gold mineralization, and (3) with chalcopyrite-pyrite mineralization containing no precious metals. The veins outcrop in a band of Late Palaeozoic(?) andesite tuff, siltstone, argillite, and limestone bordered on the northeast and southwest by Triassic(?) diorite gneiss sills. The main body of Coast Range intrusives outcropsfive miles southwest of the property, but several stocks are exposed about five miles east of the property.The regional-type metamorphism, and most of the folding and faulting of the bedded rocks on the property have been caused by orogeny associated with the Coast Range intrusives; but some recrystallization of andesite-tuff can be attributed to thermal metamorphism produoed by the adjacent diorite-gneiss sills. The vein-forming fluids are probably derived from Coast Range intrusive rather than the local sills.In the quartz-galena-pyrite veins anhedral gold fragments are associated with three soft minerals, possibly tellurides, which form inclusions in the galena. In the quartz-specularite-gold veins the gold has been deposited in disruptions between specularite 'cleavage' plates. Both classes of veins contain minor amounts of gold in or near fractures in the quartz.No veins contain both abundant specularite and abundant sulfides. The specularite probably has been deposited earlier than the sulfides but in the same period of mineralization. Specularite does not necessarily indicate hypothermal deposition, but it is usually one of the first minerals deposited from hydrothermal solutions. It is formed only under oxidizing conditions, and if exposed to later sulfide-bearing, and thus reducing, solutions, it tends to be reduced to magnetite or an iron-bearing sulfide.</dcvalue>

      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" lang="en">"This study purports to explain why French Canadians, in spite of their heritage of French culture and literature, have failed over the past four centuries, to create one single masterpiece, to give birth to one literary genius.In examining the various productions of the literature of French Canada, whether they be poems, novels or plays, one cannot but notice that they are almost completely devoid of those analyses of love, of the great passions which constitute the basis of life, and consequently of the great world literatures.It is generally conceded that literature faithfully mirrors the customs and habits of a nation. The first French colonists, who settled along the Saint Lawrence River, had not brought to the New World only Civilization and Christian faith, but also French culture and literary genius. In spite of frontier conditions, there gathered together in Quebec a small, but witty, gay and brilliant society, and the masterpieces of Racine, Corneille and even Moliere were performed.The first works written about Canada appeared by and by, almost all of them of a considerable literary value. However, in spite of the strong influence of France and of the French spirit, there was another influence slowly growing in the scattered settlements and villages, and struggling with all its might and resolution to get control over the spiritual and temporal life of the population: the influence of the Church that was far more concerned with the souls of its flock than with a national literature, which, after all, might even become dangerous.The Catholic Church did not lose its dominating influence over the French Canadians after the British conquest; on the contrary, the Clergy became their virtual leader.Thus, for almost two centuries after the English victory on the Plains of Abraham, Quebec lived behind a spiritual and intellectual iron curtain dropped by the ecclesiastics who controlled the colonyâ€™s thinking, acting, writing until the first decades of the twentieth century. French Canadian literature, of course, bears the indelible imprint of this clerical domination, and nowadays, when the Church has lost a great deal of its former power and influence, the change in French Canadian literature, is obvious.Literature - for the Canadian Clergy - was nothing but a handmaid of their religion. It follows that history, the novel, poetry, criticism and drama, became a means, and a means only, for religious propaganda.History - less dangerous from the moral point of view - was, in consequence, the most popular. French Canadians can boast of many ""Histoire du Canada"", where their historians reveal with few exceptions, of course, their own philosophy which is essentially religious. The novel, so much read and admired in Europe, was considered in French Quebec as a ""weapon forged by Satan himself to destroy Mankind"". It was almost non-existent until the beginning of the twentieth century. Only two types were allowed: the historical novel and the ""propaganda novel"". Poetry was tolerated, yet the poets were not allowed to sing of anything else but of the soil, the race, the glorious past, God and the altar, simple piety, idyllic country and community life and nature... All other objects - love and passions generally, were condemned as immoral. The rÃ´le of ""criticism"" - if we can speak of criticism - , was decidedly militants the Canadian ""official"" critics fought against ""liberal ideas"", against ""Voltairiens"", ""philosophes""â€¦ A French Canadian National Theatre was allowed in Quebec but recently.Thus, the internal struggle between Free Thought and a rather narrow-minded ""Canadian Catholicism"" is perhaps one of the most interesting aspects of French Canadian literature, and can, to a certain point, give some inkling of its future development."</dcvalue>

      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" lang="en">"Burns bog is a large sphagnum peat bog occupying approximately 4,000ha of the Fraser River delta in south-western British Columbia.The area has been extensively disturbed by peat extraction, landfillingand other land-uses. Much of the bog remains in a natural or semi-naturalstate. As such it represents one of the largest single tractsof underdeveloped land in the Corporation of Delta. Land developmentand growth in the municipality has been rapid in the past ten years.Because the Burns bog area was not well known and the pressures fordevelopment of the area were mounting, this study was initiated inJanuary 1975.Available existing environmental and land-use information pertainingto the Burns bog area was reviewed and collated. Basic vegetationand wildlife inventories were carried out in the area, and a cover map ofextant vegetation was prepared. Several aspects of peatland ecologywere investigated. These included the determination of the rate ofspagnum peat accumulation, an estimate of the energy (caloric content)of the peat stored with Burns bog, and net primary productivity.The bog was found to be floristically interesting and to be quiteunlike most of the remaining underdeveloped areas of the Fraser River lowland. Because of its large size, waterlogged character, andlocation between the Fraser River, Boundary Bay and the foreshoreareas of Roberts and Sturgeon banks, Burns bog is believed to be animportant natural refuge for many species of birds. The area isan important loafing area for waterfowl, particularly mallard, pintail,and teal, and is a nesting area for a number of raptorial ,passerine and other birds. Perhaps one of the more important birdsof Burns bog is the greater sandhill crane, which nests in the bogin small numbers.Burns bog supports a number of mammal species. In addition toa variety of ""common"" small mammals, the area supports a small numberof black bear, and Columbian black-tailed deer which are believedto be isolated populations.The land-use patterns of lands surrounding the bog area are believedto be of key importance to bird and mammal life in the area. Forexample many species of birds (ducks, raptors and sandhill cranes)and mammals (Columbian black-tailed deer and eastern cottontailrabbit) feed at the interface between the forested sections of thebog and the neighbouring agricultural lands. The agriculturalcharacter of these peripheral lands appears to influence use of thebog by various wildlife species.The peat samples analysed were found to be high in nitrogen andminerals, although these nutrients were not believed to be availablefor plant utilization.The volume of peat in the bog was crudely estimated to be 108.8 hm3 .The dry weight of this material was estimated to be 3,949,440 metrictons, and the caloric content of this material was found to beapproximately 20,023.76 G. cal. This figure is believed to be theapproximate amount of energy stored as peat in the bog.The sphagnum peat accumulation rate and net primary productivityappeared to be considerably higher at hummock sites as comparedto wet depressional areas. The average rate of accumulationof ten samples (six hummock and four -wet depression sites) was foundto be .43 cm/yr, while the average net primary productivity was128.8 g/m2 /yr.The vegetation and wildlife of the bog are largely determined bythe land-use practices surrounding and within the bog. For example,""improving"" the drainage of the area for the agricultural reclamationof the peatland, or for other purposes will probably result in therapid decomposition and subsidence of the drained peat. The increasedavailability of nutrients, and drier conditions will consequentlyalter the vegetation and wildlife species distribution in the bog."</dcvalue>

      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" lang="en">A simple method is presented, suitable for the repetitive testing necessary to investigate fully the bond characteristics in the anchorage zones of pretensioned pre-stressed members.Conditions in one anchorage zone of a member are simulated, the central zone of constant stress being replaced by a rigid steel frame. Loads in the wire on either side of the specimen are measured by load cells incorporating strain gauges. The experimental series comprised thirty specimens, of which five were prestressed with bright wire. Seventeen specimens were prestressed with rusted wire and the remainder were cast with rusted wire under zero prestress.The results show the superior anchorage characteristics of rusted wire over bright wire and the exponential nature of the load pickup of the wire in the anchorage zone. A relation is suggested between end pull in at the free end and ultimate load anchored. A short description of an investigation of the relaxation behaviour of prestress wires is appended to the thesis.</dcvalue>

      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" lang="en">To understand the system under which landrights are held in any preâ€”literate society, one must referto the cultural background since primitive tenure is usuallytied in with other aspects of culture. Thus, because aperson may hold rights in land according to his social,political and economic status, it is necessary to obtain aclear picture of the social, political, and economic structure,Because a person may obtain or lose his rights according to achange in status, one must be familiar with the rules of succession and inheritance, marriage customs and lineage ties.Public ceremony and tribal mythology are often instruments forthe validation of claims, while the means of guaranteeing rightsin land are related to the system of social control. Moreover,the reasons for desiring land can only be fully explained byreferring to cultural values.It follows that because of this relationship betweenland tenure and the rest of culture, a system of tenure will beaffected by change occurring in cultural aspects with which it islinked. For instance, when a person holds rights in land by virtueof his membership in tribe and family, a breakdown of these groupswill tend to invaliaate his claims. Again, when a shift inthe political structure leads to new concentrations of authority,different means of controlling land may arise. A changingeconomy may free people from dependence upon the old social groupand thus lead to the individualization of title. When ceremonialism plays an important part in the validation of land rights, itssubmergence tends to cause confusion of claims.In studying the effects of culture contact upon theTsimshian system of land tenure during the nineteenth century) thewriter began by examining the traditional system of tenure and itsrelationship to other aspects of culture. The place of the social, political and economic structure in the land tenure schemewas determined, as was the part played by ceremonialism, mythologyand the system of social control. The nature of culture contactand its influence upon these aspects of culture was then reviewed.Finally, the writer attempted to determine to what extent the systemof tenure was itself affected.</dcvalue>

A 30 MeV Ï€â&#x81;» beam was degraded and stopped in a 1.9 cm thick liquid Â³He target. The high-energy photons, from the inflight Ï€Â°â†’Î³Î³ decay and the radiative capture channels, were detected by a large NaI(Tl) crystal (46 cm âˆ… x 51 cm). The large distance (2.8 meters) between the crystal and the helium target provided a good time-of-flight selection of the photons, with a negligible neutron contamination. A 4.5% resolution at 135.8 MeV was achieved by the detector and made possible a good separation between the radiative break-up channels (dnÎ³ + pnnÎ³) and the peak of interest (Â³HÎ³). About 1.1 x 10â&#x81;µ photon events were observed in the data presented in this work. After subtraction of the target empty backgrounds, the theoretical line shapes were folded with the experimental energy resolution and fitted to the data. The Amado model was used to represent the break-up channels and thus extract the Panofsky ratio. A value of Pâ‚ƒ = 2.83 Â± 0.07 was determined, not including the inflight corrections and assuming for Â³He the internal conversion rate of hydrogen. A general picture of the radiative pion capture processes in nuclei is also given, in which [unclear] is a test case for the impulse approximation and the hypothesis of partial conservation of axial-vector current in nuclei. Moreover, a second ratio, Bâ‚ƒ, between the radiative capture processes (ratio of the break-up channels to the elastic channel) has been measured to be Bâ‚ƒ = 1.35 Â± 0.11.</dcvalue>

      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" lang="en">"The recent developments in the European Community evoked bythe Single European Act and commonly referred to as the creationof ""Fortress Europe"" by the end of 1992 have been attractedconsiderable attention with respect to economic and politicalintegration in the international arena. Similarly, theconclusion of the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement aiming at aloose form of economic integration received significantrecognition.These two agreements cover not only liberalization of tradein goods and services but moreover, include foreign directinvestment. This is of particular significance since littleprogress has been made in its regulation on an internationallevel in comparison to the regulation of trade in goods. Due tothe fact that direct investment is primarily exercised by largemultinational enterprises it has a larger political impact on thehost countries than trade in goods and services. Foreignownership of local industry creates the concern of economicdependence and of a loss of sovereign powers among hostgovernments. Consequently, governments introduce laws andregulations aiming at the restriction of direct investment offoreign investors.However, as foreign investment augments economic growth, itis of common benefit to both investors and host countries toprovide an investment climate which balances the conflict ofinterest between the need of legal certainty and flexibility forforeign investors arid the safeguard of economic independence andpolitical freedom of host country governments to introduce andmaintain measures deemed necessary for the benefit of theirnational economies.This thesis will demonstrate the most effective regime tosolve this conflict through comparison of the Free TradeAgreement with the Treaty of Rome as amended by the SingleEuropean Act. These agreements have been chosen since theyinvolve two of the triad world economic powers and thus,represent industrialized nations with the highest degree offoreign direct investment aiming at the liberalization of directinvestment in their ""enlarged"" markets.The thesis is divided into three parts. The first andsecond parts will discuss the degree of liberalization of foreigninvestment within the Common Market including the progress madeunder the Single European Act of 1986 and within the free tradearea established by the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement in 1989.The analysis will centre around the issues of free establishmentof companies, the National Treatment Principle, capital movement,and mergers and acquisitions. The third part consists of thecomparative analysis and will provide the final conclusions.The conclusions will show that the two agreements share fewsimilarities but they are characterized by their divergentapproach to direct investment liberalization. It is submittedthat the more comprehensive form of liberalization is reached in the Common Market due to its broad restraint on sovereign powersof its Member States and coherently implemented elimination ofrestrictions on foreign investment. In contrast, the Free TradeAgreement only imposes selected obligations on the parties toliberalize direct investment. It will become clear that the FreeTrade Agreement stands for a settlement of the most vexinginvestment issues between the parties rather than a commitment tovirtually liberalize investment between the U.S. and Canada.In view of this result, recommendations are made to furtherliberalize investment under the Free Trade Agreement. These haveto be seen, however, in the light of numerous economic andpolitical divergencies between the Common Market and the U.S.-Canadian free trade area."</dcvalue>

      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" lang="en">"This thesis examines the attitudes to love and sex reflected in eight Canadian novels dating from 1925 to 1969. The first three, Frederick Philip Grove's Settlers of the Marsh, Morley Callaghan's They Shall Inherit the Earth, and Hugh MacLennan's The Watch That Ends the Night, were chosen not only as works centrally concerned with love, but also as good examples of their writers' treatment of sexuality in other novels. And since Grove, Callaghan, and MacLennan are generally held to be the major Canadian writers of at least the first half of this century, collectively their novels form an accurate picture of the traditional, mainstream attitude to sex, insofar as it can be seen operating in and through fiction.Chapter One introduces the reader to the ways in which twentieth-century Canadian fictional attitudes to love and sex are directly contiguous with those of Victorian England: the fundamental duality of body and soul; the ""worship"" of the good woman as the embodiment of the Christian virtue of self-sacrificing, pure love; the resulting splitting off of aggressive sexuality from feelings of tenderness; and the subsequent driving underground of the repressed sexual urges and their emergence into perverse forms.Chapter Two traces Grove's insistence upon a tender, asexual Victorian ideal and his deliberate efforts to eliminate what he regards as degrading and destructive, that is, any sexual urges not strictly passive and subordinate to spiritual love and monogamous procreation. Chapter Three discusses Callaghan's attempt to break away from this traditional duality of love and sex, and then demonstrates how his fusion of body and soul actually breaks down into just another version of the old split so that sex is good only so long as it remains in the service of self-sacrificing love. It also establishes how Callaghan's notion of love comes to depend ultimately upon covert sadomasochism in which both the male and female unconsciously and destructively attempt to break out of sexual roles too rigid and narrow to serve their complex human needs. Chapter Four looks at MacLennan's apparent affirmation of life and sex, and maintains that his mystical message is really a sadomasochistic impulse in which life becomes the unconscious and obsessive pursuit after pain and death.The relationship which emerges between the sexes in all three of these novels is that of dominant female and dependent, resentful, frightened male. Grove, Callaghan, and MacLellan all portray women as essentially stronger than their men: the ""good"" ones dominate by means of protective, maternal power and the ""bad"" ones through aggressive, self-gratifying sexuality. The male responses to these powerful women are deeply ambivalent: they seek infantile security and gratification at the breasts of the ""good"" women, while they simultaneously attempt to establish their potency, autonomy and safety by overtly destroying the ""bad"" mothers and covertly punishing the ""good"" ones. Thus Grove, Callaghan and MacLennan all create fictional worlds in which sadomasochism inadvertently works against their notions of idealized love. Chapters Five and Six examine Sheila Watson's The Double Hook and Mordecai Richler's The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz, concentrating on their more contemporary treatment of sexaulity and particularly on their response to the archetype of the castrating mother. Watson pioneers the way out of the Victorian past by exploring aggression as a potentially positive mode of behaviour, and by seeing in the traditional role of the self-sacrificing woman the kind of tyranny-by-guilt which covertly holds sway in the earlier works. Richler also rejects the notion of the efficacy of suffering and thus has his young hero attain manhood partially through his repudiation of the ""security"" offered in a relationship with a self-sacrificing woman. Moreover, his satire repeatedly focuses on the covert sexual reality which underlies idealistic pretensions, and thus makes the same comment as this thesis is making about the novels of the traditional mainstream.Chapter Seven analyzes the ways in which Leonard Cohen's Beautiful Losers, Margaret Laurence's The Fire-Dwellers and Robert Kroetsch's The Studhorse Man all work through various responses to the repressive limitations of Victorian ideals: Cohen dramatizes an ideal of polymorphous perversity, Laurence ""masculinizes"" her heroine and ""feminizes"" her male protagonists, and Kroetsch insists upon an unidealized, aggressively sexual response to life.Nevertheless, as Chapter Seven demonstrates, even contemporary imaginations continue to focus on the woman as castrating mother and the man as threatened son. Thus in the final analysis, the differences between the attitudes of contemporary writers and those of their predecessors lie not in an abandonment of the traditional archtype, but only in the degree to which they are conscious of, and deliberately choosing to work with, sado-masochistic sexuality."</dcvalue>

The rate law was found to be of the form[ Formula omitted ]The two rate constants were identified with reaction paths involving activated complexes of the compositions (U.OH.T1)â&#x81;¶â&#x81;º and (U.O.T1)â&#x81;µâ&#x81;º , respectively. The corresponding heats and entropies of activation, evaluated from rate measurements over the temperature range 16 to 25Â°, are Î”Hâ‚&#x81;Â± = 24.6 kcal/mole, Î”Hâ‚‚Â± = 21.7 kcal/mole, Î”Sâ‚&#x81;Â±= 16 e.u. and Î”Sâ‚‚Â±= 7 e.u. The effect of ionic strength and the specific effects of various anions and cations on the rate were examined. The results suggest, but do not prove, that the reaction occurs through a single two-equivalent step rather than through successive one electron changes.The homogeneous oxidation of carbon monoxide by metal ions in aqueous solutions was studied. At temperatures below 80Â° only HgÂ²â&#x81;º and MnOâ‚„Â¯ were found to oxidize carbon monoxide. The ions CuÂ²â&#x81;º , Agâ&#x81;º , Hgâ‚‚Â²â&#x81;º , FeÂ³â&#x81;º , T1Â³â&#x81;º and Crâ‚‚Oâ‚‡Â²Â¯, were inactive.Kinetic measurements of the reaction2HgÂ²â&#x81;º+  CO + Hâ‚‚O â†’ Hgâ‚‚Â²â&#x81;º+ + COâ‚‚ + 2Hâ&#x81;ºin dilute perchloric acid over the temperature range 26 to 54Â° yielded the rate law[ Formula omitted ]The activation parameters are Î”HÂ± = 14.6 kcal/mole and Î”SÂ± =-13 e.u. It is believed that the reaction proceeds by a mechanism which involves the insertion of CO between HgÂ²â&#x81;º and a coordinated water molecule [ Formula omitted ]The oxidation of carbon monoxide by MnOâ‚„Â¯ was found to proceed readily over the temperature range 28 to 50Â°. The rate law was found to be [ Formula omitted ]with Î”HÂ± = 13 kcal/mole and Î”SÂ± = -17 e.u., both substantially constant over the pH range 1 to 13. The rate determining step is considered to be the formation of hypomanganateMnOâ‚„Â¯+ CO + Hâ‚‚O â†’ MnOâ‚„Â³Â¯ + COâ‚‚ + 2Hwhich then undergoes further fast reactions to yield MnOâ‚„Â²Â¯ in basic solution and MnOâ‚‚ in acid and neutral solutions.A remarkable feature of the latter reaction is its very marked sensitivity to catalysis by Agâ&#x81;º and HgÂ²â&#x81;º (but not by CuÂ²â&#x81;º, CdÂ²â&#x81;º, FeÂ³â&#x81;º, or T1Â³â&#x81;º ). The rate law of the catalyzed path is, in each case,[ Formula omitted ]where M = Agâ&#x81;º or HgÂ²â&#x81;º. For Agâ&#x81;º, k at 0Â° is 1.10 x 10â&#x81;µ MÂ¯Â² secÂ¯Â¹ with Î”HÂ± = 1.3 kcal/mole and Î”SÂ± = -30 e.u.

      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" lang="en">Modern communication protocols present the software designer with problems of asynchrony, real-time response, high throughput, robust exception handling, and multi-level interfacing. An operating system which provides lightweight processes and inexpensive inter-process communication offers solutions to all of these problems. This thesis examines the use of the multi-process structuring facilities of one such operating system, Verex, to implement the protocols defined by CCITT Recommendation X.25. The success of the multi-process design is confirmed by a working implementation that has linked a Verex system to the Datapac public network for over a year.The processes which make up the Verex X.25 software are organized into layers according to the layered definition of X.25. Within the layers, some processes take the form of finite-state machines which execute the state transitions specified in the protocol definition. Matching the structure of the software to the structure of the specification results in software which is easy to program, easy to understand, and likely to be correct.Multi-process structuring can be applied with similar benefits to protocols other than X.25 and systems other than Verex.</dcvalue>

In SbÂ¹Â²â&#x81;´. No.new gamma rays were observed from Coâ&#x81;¶â&#x81;°.PART 2A search for double beta decay in SnÂ¹Â²â&#x81;´ has been made using a coincidence technique particularly suited to double beta decay under the Majorana form of neutrino theory. Negative results were obtained and a lower limit of 0.3 - 0.7 x 10Â¹â&#x81;· years has been set on the half-life of the process.</dcvalue>

      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" lang="en">Fluid flow through liquid interdendritic channels of a partially remelted lead-tin casting has been measured directly, with gravity as the driving force. The results were shown to be consistent with Darcy's Law. The permeability of the dendritic array was found to be a function of the square of the primary dendrite spacing, and was observed to increase with time due to coarsening of the dendritic structure.The formation of casting defects in lead-tin alloys was studied with isothermal and unidirectional solidification experiments. Solute convection was observed when the liquid close to the bottom of the solid-liquid region was less dense than the liquid above, using radioactive tracer techniques. Macrosegregation was shown to be related to the solidification conditions, and channel-type defects, resembling freckles and A segregates, were formed when the rising interdendritic liquid dissolved dendrite branches in its path.A simple mathematical model is proposed, which predicts the composition profiles in vertical, directionally solidified lead-tin castings, as a function of the structure, growth rate, and temperature gradient. The model is shown to agree qualitatively with the experiments, and can be used to recommend specific changes in casting practice to reduce gravity segregation effects.</dcvalue>

      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" lang="en">"The purpose of this dissertation is to advance our understanding of the intentionality ofmental states through a critical examination of Fred Dretske's theory of mind.Dretske's theorizing is constrained by his desire both to save central features of our""pretheoretic"" conception of mind and, at the same time, to be appropriately ""materialistic""(and hence ""naturalistic""). Dretske's materialism is captured in his claim that: ""...the crucialpoint is that whatever set of facts we select to analyze the mental are facts which, takenindividually, are recognizably physical â€” the sort that exist, or can exist, in a world devoid ofminds"" (Dretske 1994a, p. 131). Central features of our pretheoretic conception of mind thatDretske wishes to preserve include:- that ordinary categories such as thought, belief, and desire capture real categories ofmental states,- that mental states are certain kinds of representational states, and therefore they havesemantic content (meaning),- that a mental state's having a particular representational content is an explanatorilyrelevant (because causally relevant) fact about it.Dretske proposes that intentional, representational contents of the cognitive states of acognitive system are fixed by the history of information-bearing relations (also called""indicational"" relations) that those states of the system have had to aspects of the system'senvironment. Further, the resulting representational contents are themselves essentially andentirely relational in nature. One cognitive system with an internal configurationtype-identical to another, but with type-distinct (or in the limiting case no) history of indicational relations to its environment, will have type-distinct (or in the limiting case no)representational contents.Within these constraints, then, Dretske must show both how mental representation ispossible and also how it is causal-explanatorily relevant to behaviour. As such, it isindicational relations that need to provide the basis both for an account of how a cognitivestate comes to have its given content, and also for an account of the causal-explanatory rolethat its having that very content may have for the behaviour of the cognitive system whosestate it is. However, 1 argue that indicational relations per se can do neither. This is soparticularly on Dretske's own, strong, conception of indication. Buiiit even on weakerconceptions proposed by others as a remedy, factors which ought to count as intentional byDretske's own lights (and which are importantly non-relational) become important contributorsto intentional content determination in a way that would commit the overall account to ageneral and pervasive circularity. 1 argue that some of these factors, having to do with mattersof ""receptivity"" and perceptual ""discrimination"", are endemic to the very processes of operantconditioning that Dretske must appeal to as contributing to the rise of states with intentionalcontents."</dcvalue>

      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" lang="en">"During the 1920s and 1930s in Europe, Andre Breton was actively engaged in anti-colonial pursuits as a result of his commitment to socialist international revolutionary politics. That this was the case is evident in the numerous treatises and lectures in which Breton spoke out against imperialism and its oppression of non-Western peoples. During the same period, Breton also collected and displayed North American indigenous objects. When Breton was forced to flee to New York in the 1940s due to fascist persecution, he continued to engage in these practices. Rather than viewing these activities as separate and unrelated, this thesis intends to argue that one of the reasons North American indigenous objects were collected and evoked by Breton was because the societies that produced them occupied an exalted place within European socialist ideology. Certainly, there have been art historical studies devotedto the subject of Breton's aligning surrealism with socialist international revolutionary causes. Moreover, in the existing writings on surrealism and indigenous peoples, the attentionpaid to North American indigenous societies by Breton has been noted. However, in this latter discourse, Breton's interest inNorth American aboriginal groups, whether in Europe or in the United States and Canada, has been confined to issues of mythology, psychoanalysis, aesthetics and connoisseurship and, hence, the left wing political importance of these societies hasbeen overlooked. Drawing upon the body of post-colonial critiques engaging the cooption and appropriation of other cultures by the West, this thesis will investigate the European socialist significance of North American indigenous societies and bring it to a discussion of Breton's collecting and display practices. Of particular importance in this matter are the writings of Frederick Engels in which ethnographic data on North American aboriginal peoples was used to offer ""proof"" that the first human communities existed in a state of primordial communism. What will be argued is that varied dimensions of these imaginarysocieties were evoked by Breton in left wing strategies during the 1930s and 1940s as part of an oppositional stand againstbourgeois ideology, imperialism, fascism and war. To be sure, the collecting and exhibiting of indigenous objects brimming with socialist significance was not solelydefined by political activism; these pursuits were as well bound up with issues of avant-gardism and so-alled ""primitivism."" In order to pursue this matter, this thesis will also draw upon analyses of modernism and the avant-garde in order to provide aclearer view of how and why certain North American aboriginal peoples were drawn into Breton's artistic and political international revolutionary avant-garde strategies at various moments and in differing geographic locales."</dcvalue>

      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" lang="en">"This is a comparative study between ""The Tale of Genji"" and ""The Ramayana"" which are masterpieces of Japanese and Indian literature, in the theme of the descent of the heroes, Genji and Rama. There are two types of 'descent': one is the external descent which is exile, and the other is the internal descent which is lament. The latter seems to be more important and more profound in the meaning, especially from the Japanese viewpoint. In terms of the theme of the work, the Wakana chapter of ""The Tale of Genji"" is one of the most important chapters because of its consensus of meaning and interpretation. Although the comparative study between Japanese and Indian literature is very rare, except for Buddistic studies, I would like to make an attempt to search for a new possibility in the study field of literature by starting to examine the heroic powers of Genji and Rama,"</dcvalue>

      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" lang="en">A classification of the bog and forest ecosystems along four topographic transects near Prince Rupert, British Columbia is developed and described. The study area is classified within the Coastal - Cedars - Pine - Hemlock zone (CCPH) according to the British Columbia Ministry of Forest's Biogeoclimatic classification system. Detailed vegetation, soil, site and mensuration data were collected from a total of 40 releves that were chosen according to the Braun - Blanquet approach of sampling distinct, homogeneous examples of climax vegetation. Vegetation data were analyzed using subjective tabular comparison, together with three objective ordination techniques; polar ordination, principal components analysis and reciprocal averaging. Tabular comparison and ordination proved to be complementary in developing and evaluating the classification, and in displaying relationships within and among the community types. It was recognized, however, that subjective rather than systematic sampling places limits on the interpretation of the ordinations. The vegetation, soils and landforms of six community types making up the blanket bog - upland forest complex of the study area are described in detail and vegetation - environment relationships are discussed. A cool, perhumid, rainy, hyperoceanic climate is considered the overriding factor influencing vegetation and soil development. Important associated controlling factors are; soil drainage, through its influence on soil water regimes and nutrient turnover; the two important soil forming processes of organic matter accumulation and podzolization; landform and topography, through their effect on soil drainage; and bedrock geology, through its effect on soil nutrient regimes and drainage. Vegetation - environment relationships on the north coastal mainland appear similar to those described in Southeast Alaska and on the southern and western Queen Charlotte Islands. There are, however, some significant floristic and geologic distinctions among these geographic areas. The oceanic blanket bog ecosystems of the north Pacific coast show many relationships with those in the western British Isles and, to a lesser extent, with those of eastern Newfoundland. The historical development of a bog woodland is reconstructed using pollen analysis, peat stratigraphy and C-14 dating. The succession spans 8700 +/- 210 years in the following sequence: Pinus contorta - Alnus rubra - ferns/ pioneer alluvial forest; Picea sitchensis - Alnus rubra -Tsuga heterophylla - (Thuja plicata) - Lysichiton americanum -ferns/moist productive alluvial forest on Regosols; Thuja plicata - Chamaecyparis nootkatensis - Tsuga heterophylla -Pinus contorta/scrub forest on peaty mineral soils; Pinus contorta - Chamaecyparis nootkatensis - ericaceous shrubs -Sphagnum spp. /bog woodland on organic soils. This ecosystem sequence is correlated with changes in paleoclimate reported for southwestern British Columbia, and may also be associated with edaphic factors such as changing drainage patterns, the formation of cemented soil horizons and the accumulation of thick organic surface horizons. The palynological, floristic and edaphic evidence for succession from forest to muskeg is contrasted with other edaphic evidence for succession from muskeg to forest in north coastal British Columbia and Southeast Alaska. I interpret the regional vegetation and soils as a dynamic complex of ecosystems linked successionally through a climatically sensitive pathway. Local site factors such as topography, landform, drainage and nutrient regime are important secondary factors controlling the direction of succession. The problem of defining the climatic climax vegetation along the north Pacific coast, where succession has proceeded in the absence of major disturbances such as fire for thousands of years, is addressed. I conclude that the scrub upland forests of Thuja plicata, Chamaecyparis nootkatensis and Tsuga heterophylla that predominate on the moderate slopes throughout the study area, appear to best express the macroclimate and should therefore be considered the climatic climax. However, this may not apply to the exposed outer coast where open blanket bog and bog woodland dominate the landscape, even on slopes.</dcvalue>
