      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" lang="en">To understand the system under which landrights are held in any preâ€”literate society, one must referto the cultural background since primitive tenure is usuallytied in with other aspects of culture. Thus, because aperson may hold rights in land according to his social,political and economic status, it is necessary to obtain aclear picture of the social, political, and economic structure,Because a person may obtain or lose his rights according to achange in status, one must be familiar with the rules of succession and inheritance, marriage customs and lineage ties.Public ceremony and tribal mythology are often instruments forthe validation of claims, while the means of guaranteeing rightsin land are related to the system of social control. Moreover,the reasons for desiring land can only be fully explained byreferring to cultural values.It follows that because of this relationship betweenland tenure and the rest of culture, a system of tenure will beaffected by change occurring in cultural aspects with which it islinked. For instance, when a person holds rights in land by virtueof his membership in tribe and family, a breakdown of these groupswill tend to invaliaate his claims. Again, when a shift inthe political structure leads to new concentrations of authority,different means of controlling land may arise. A changingeconomy may free people from dependence upon the old social groupand thus lead to the individualization of title. When ceremonialism plays an important part in the validation of land rights, itssubmergence tends to cause confusion of claims.In studying the effects of culture contact upon theTsimshian system of land tenure during the nineteenth century) thewriter began by examining the traditional system of tenure and itsrelationship to other aspects of culture. The place of the social, political and economic structure in the land tenure schemewas determined, as was the part played by ceremonialism, mythologyand the system of social control. The nature of culture contactand its influence upon these aspects of culture was then reviewed.Finally, the writer attempted to determine to what extent the systemof tenure was itself affected.</dcvalue>
