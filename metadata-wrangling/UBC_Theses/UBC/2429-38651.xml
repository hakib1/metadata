      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" lang="en">The kinetics of the electron transfer reactionU(IV) + T1(III) â†’ U(VI) + T1(I)were examined in aqueous perchloric acid solution. The rate law was found to be of the form[ Formula omitted ]The two rate constants were identified with reaction paths involving activated complexes of the compositions (U.OH.T1)â&#x81;¶â&#x81;º and (U.O.T1)â&#x81;µâ&#x81;º , respectively. The corresponding heats and entropies of activation, evaluated from rate measurements over the temperature range 16 to 25Â°, are Î”Hâ‚&#x81;Â± = 24.6 kcal/mole, Î”Hâ‚‚Â± = 21.7 kcal/mole, Î”Sâ‚&#x81;Â±= 16 e.u. and Î”Sâ‚‚Â±= 7 e.u. The effect of ionic strength and the specific effects of various anions and cations on the rate were examined. The results suggest, but do not prove, that the reaction occurs through a single two-equivalent step rather than through successive one electron changes.The homogeneous oxidation of carbon monoxide by metal ions in aqueous solutions was studied. At temperatures below 80Â° only HgÂ²â&#x81;º and MnOâ‚„Â¯ were found to oxidize carbon monoxide. The ions CuÂ²â&#x81;º , Agâ&#x81;º , Hgâ‚‚Â²â&#x81;º , FeÂ³â&#x81;º , T1Â³â&#x81;º and Crâ‚‚Oâ‚‡Â²Â¯, were inactive.Kinetic measurements of the reaction2HgÂ²â&#x81;º+  CO + Hâ‚‚O â†’ Hgâ‚‚Â²â&#x81;º+ + COâ‚‚ + 2Hâ&#x81;ºin dilute perchloric acid over the temperature range 26 to 54Â° yielded the rate law[ Formula omitted ]The activation parameters are Î”HÂ± = 14.6 kcal/mole and Î”SÂ± =-13 e.u. It is believed that the reaction proceeds by a mechanism which involves the insertion of CO between HgÂ²â&#x81;º and a coordinated water molecule [ Formula omitted ]The oxidation of carbon monoxide by MnOâ‚„Â¯ was found to proceed readily over the temperature range 28 to 50Â°. The rate law was found to be [ Formula omitted ]with Î”HÂ± = 13 kcal/mole and Î”SÂ± = -17 e.u., both substantially constant over the pH range 1 to 13. The rate determining step is considered to be the formation of hypomanganateMnOâ‚„Â¯+ CO + Hâ‚‚O â†’ MnOâ‚„Â³Â¯ + COâ‚‚ + 2Hwhich then undergoes further fast reactions to yield MnOâ‚„Â²Â¯ in basic solution and MnOâ‚‚ in acid and neutral solutions.A remarkable feature of the latter reaction is its very marked sensitivity to catalysis by Agâ&#x81;º and HgÂ²â&#x81;º (but not by CuÂ²â&#x81;º, CdÂ²â&#x81;º, FeÂ³â&#x81;º, or T1Â³â&#x81;º ). The rate law of the catalyzed path is, in each case,[ Formula omitted ]where M = Agâ&#x81;º or HgÂ²â&#x81;º. For Agâ&#x81;º, k at 0Â° is 1.10 x 10â&#x81;µ MÂ¯Â² secÂ¯Â¹ with Î”HÂ± = 1.3 kcal/mole and Î”SÂ± = -30 e.u. For HgÂ²â&#x81;º, k at 0Â° is 1.09 x 10Â³ MÂ¯Â² secÂ¯Â¹ with Î”HÂ± = 6.5 kcal/mole and Î”SÂ± = -21 e.u. It is suggested that the remarkably high reactivities exhibited by carbon monoxide in these catalytic reactions are related to favourable oxidation paths involving intermediates such as [ Formula omitted ]</dcvalue>
