      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" lang="en">This was a descriptive study of the agreements reached by learningassistants and classroom teachers when identifying a student's problem(s) duringa consultative problem identification interview. The behavioral consultationresearch literature suggested that problem identification was a critical componentof the problem solving process (Bergan &amp; Tombari, 1976) however, the reliabilityof information gathered during the consultation interviews required furtherinvestigation (White &amp; Edelstein, 1991). This study addressed the issue ofreliability of the problem identification interview in consultation by examininginterrater and interparticipant agreements as to the priority, nature and numberof problems identified during the interview.Nine learning assistance teachers conducted problem identificationinterviews with each of four classroom teachers from their individual schoolsregarding students who the teacher identified as difficult to teach. Participantsrated their problem identification interviews with an evaluative rating scale ofinterview helpfulness, and levels of problem identification and sharedunderstanding in their interview dyad. Post consultation interviews with eachparticipant revealed the levels to which each identified the presenting problemsi n priority by nature and number. Results reported the level to which eachinterview dyad (N=36) agreed upon the problem(s) identified. Two raters gaveindependent ratings to the level of shared understanding of the problem(s)identified by the participants as well as to the priority, number and nature of theproblem(s). Participant-rater agreements were determined for the samevariables.The results reported a moderate level of agreement (Kappa=.66)between the participants as to the nature of the highest priority problem. Amoderate level of agreement was determined between Rater 2 and the learningassistance teachers (K=.67) and the classroom teachers (K=.78) regarding thenature of the highest priority problem as well.The implication of these findings suggested that the dynamic process ofproblem identification is reliable. However, the process may result in lack ofcomplete agreement between participants until the process results in problemdescriptions which are specific enough to allow problem solution to beattempted. A replication of this study is needed to further validate these results.Further research is warranted in order to confirm the level at which problemidentification is completed.</dcvalue>
