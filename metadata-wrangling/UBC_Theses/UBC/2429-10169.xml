      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" lang="en">The imperial praetorian guard was an elite unit of the Roman army,whose primary responsibility was to safeguard the emperor and his family.Adapted from a republican institution by Augustus, it in essence formed thepersonal army of the emperor. Yet, within a very short time, the praetoriansbecame responsible for specialized military tasks involving issues of security,and for various administrative duties in Rome. This evolution occurred primarilybecause of the close relationship between the guard and the emperor, who sawthat such a large number of soldiers in the city could be put to good use for hisown benefit, and for the advantage of the state. Not only would they assist in themanagement of the capital, they also would serve as a constant reminder to thepopulace of the substantial armed force that formed the basis of imperial rule.Previous studies of the guard have concentrated on its organization androle as the imperial bodyguard. Yet it is through an examination of the otherresponsibilities of the praetorians that a more comprehensive understanding oftheir position in the state can be deduced. The purpose of the present study is toexamine those aspects of the guard that are outside its basic mandate ofproviding protection for the imperial household. The development of thepraetorians into a unit that carried out political espionage, fought fires in the city,and was employed as security at the games provides insight into the nature ofthe early principate, which relied on armed force to maintain its authority. Theexpanded role of the guard in the Julio-Claudian period can be viewed as the deliberate integration of the military into the fabric of Roman administration. Byplacing soldiers who owed their allegiance only to him in key roles in the capital,the emperor was able to consolidate his hold on power while, at the same time,often providing much needed services that benefited the state as a whole.</dcvalue>
