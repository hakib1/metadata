      <dcvalue element="description" qualifier="abstract" lang="en">A HeÂ³ cryostat was designed for steady state nuclear magnetic resonance measurements. The cryostat required about one liter of HeÂ³ at NTP. This amount of HeÂ³ was liquified at 1.2Â°K, which was the temperature of the surrounding liquid Heâ&#x81;´ bath, and then pumped on by means of a four-stage mercury diffusion pump. By this procedure, a liquid HeÂ³ temperature of 0.35 K was achieved and maintained for four hours. The r-f coil and sample were in direct contact with the liquid HeÂ³ to ensure sufficient heat transfer between the two. The temperature of the liquid HeÂ³ was measured by means of vapour pressure measurements of the evaporating HeÂ³ and by means of resistance measurements of a carbon resistance in contact with the liquid HeÂ³. The system was non-recirculating, since a total, uninterrupted run of four hours was considered long enough for most experiments. The HeÂ³ could also be retransferred within 20 minutes after such a run, and this process could be continued until in-sufficient quantities of liquid Heâ&#x81;´remained to cool the surroundings.</dcvalue>
