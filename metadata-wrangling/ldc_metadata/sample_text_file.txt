Set of keys, including: a transparent blue plastic squarish fob with rounded corners; a bicycle lock key with oblong oval-ish black plastic grip (I think); a key with a dab of pink nail polish on the grip; a short key (mail box); and at least 2 other keys (5 keys and 1 fob, I believe). It's a long shot.
