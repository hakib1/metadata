Between 1957 and 1964 Dr. Thomas served as Associate Professor of History at the Regina campus. His history, The University of Saskatchewan, 1909-1959, was complemented by a number of articles related to archival development in Canada; exploration; and Saskatchewan history.

Corporate body	Assiniboia Community Housing Cooperative		The Assiniboia Community Housing Cooperative (ACHC) began its existence known as Campus Co-operative Association in March of 1967. Its initiative at that time was to provide low-cost housing to students at the University of Alberta, in a time before HUB, Lister Hall, or Michener Park were completed.     In September of 1967, the University’s Board of Governors, whose task it was to oversee University-owned properties, rented six houses to the fledgling organization in the North Garneau area. By the early 1970’s, the Co-op reached its membership peak of about 65 members, and purchased their first house in the Strathcona area. A second home was purchased in 1973 in Parkallen. Using a ‘capital loan’ system where members ‘loaned’ the Co-op $25 each upon taking out membership, monies were collected for initial down payments on homes. A ‘capital levy’ plan was later introduced whereby the Co-op charged a capital levy per member, on top of the monthly housing charge, as a means of raising capital for the expansion of the Co-op and for meeting maintenance costs on existing properties. In the early 1970’s, as well, the Co-op obtained a further four rented houses from the City of Edmonton. Original University-owned houses were occasionally demolished in the North Garneau neighbourhood, and the Co-op received other houses in replacement. A few other houses were rented from private landlords and by the summer of 1973, there were twelve houses in the Campus Co-operative Association.     In 1977 the Campus Co-operative Association was dissolved by the Co-op Development Branch of the Alberta Department of Consumer and Corporate body Affairs for failing to submit an audit form on time. A new set of by-laws and a policy manual were developed and the Co-op was reinCorporate bodyd on September 27, 1978 as the Campus Co-operative Association (1977). By 1981, the new name of Assiniboia Community Housing Cooperative was chosen to reflect a shift away from a majority student membership which prevailed at its inception in 1967.     Membership in the houses was open to anyone accepted by the members of a Co-op household, and subsequently approved by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors consisted of four executive members elected at semi-annual general meetings, and of one house representative from each house; board meetings were held monthly, and were open to the general membership to attend. Various committees were established to deal with specific matters, and members were expected to work on a committee or do some other specified work for the Cooperative. Members also shared cooking and other house chores. Membership criteria evolved over time to accept both student and non-student membership, and houses were co-ed. In 1986, the AHCC owned five houses and ceased leasing property from the University.     While the records in the fonds go only to 1990, the Assiniboia Community Housing Cooperative continues to function. They are a listed entry in the University of Alberta’s Student Union Housing Registry (as of 2006), and advertise three houses available in the Cooperative.	The central aim of the cooperative housing associations at the University is to provide low cost housing to students.  The Campus Co-operative Association was founded in 1967.  It was dissolved and amalgamated with Campus Co-operative Association (1977), which changed its name to Assiniboia Housing Community Cooperative in 1981.  In 1986 the AHCC owned five houses and ceased leasing property from the University.	assiniboia-community-housing-cooperative.xml

Person	Rutherford, Alexander Cameron	1857- 02-02 - 7.12.1941	Alexander Cameron Rutherford was born in Osgoode, Carleton County, Ontario, on February 2, 1857. His parents emigrated to Canada from Aberfeldy, Scotland in 1855. Educated in Ontario's public schools, and Woodstock College, he taught school for a year and then attended McGill University in Montreal where he graduated with a B.A. and B.C.L. in 1881. He articled with Sir Ricarhd Scott in Ottawa, was admitted to the Bar of Ontario in 1885 and immediately went into the partnership of Hodgins, Kidd and Rutherford with offices in Ottawa and Kempville.     In 1888 he married M. Birkett and two children, Cecil, and Hazel, were born to them. He came west to Strathcona, Northwest Territories, and was elected to the North West Territories Assembly serving from 1902-1905. During this period he was Deputy Speaker. In 1905, he was called to lead the first government of Alberta. Dr. Rutherford also held the portfolios of Provincial Treaseuer and Minister of Education. He introduced, in 1906, a bill which founded the University of Ablerta. In recognition of his efforts to establish higher education in the new prairie province, the Univerwsity of Toronto awarded him an LL.D. in 1907.     Although Dr. Rutherford resigned as Premier in 1910, he continued to take an interest in the Univesrity. He was elected its Chancellor in 1927 and continued in that position until his death on June 12, 1941.	Lawyer, Politician, Chancellor, 1857-1941.

Person	Watson, Wilfred	1911 - 1998	"Wilfred Watson was born in Rochester, England in 1911, the oldest child of Frederick Walter Watson and the former Louisa Claydon. He immigrated to Canada with his family at the age of fifteen, settling in Duncan, British Columbia. After one year of highschool, he found a job with a Vancouver Island sawmill. Watson attended the University of British Columbia from 1940 to 1943, earning a B.A. in English literature. During the Second World War, he served in the Canadian navy; after the war he continued his education at the University of Toronto, receiving an M.A. in 1946 and a Ph.D. in 1951. In 1949, Wilfred Watson was employed as a special lecturer in English at the University of British Columbia and from 1951 to 1953 he became professor in the Department of English at the University of Alberta, teaching at the Calgary campus. In 1954, he transferred to the Edmonton campus, remaining there as Professor of English until his retirement in 1977.    Wilfred Watson married Sheila Martin Doherty in 1941, who as Sheila Watson published The Double Hook in 1959. The Watson's both taught at the University of Alberta and participated in an intellectual circle that included the painter Norman Yates, and actor-directors Gordon Peacock and Thomas Peacocke among others (see Stefan Haag, M.A. thesis). Watson co-founded the Jazz Club ""Yardbird Suite"" in Edmonton in the early 1960's, and joined the editorial group of White Pelican (a quarterly review of the arts) in 1972. Wilfred Watson retired from the University of Alberta in 1977 and moved in 1980 to Nanaimo, B.C. with his wife Sheila. He passed away very shortly after his wife Sheila in Nanaimo in 1998, at the age of 87.    Wilfred Watson's writing career was prolific and continuously evolving and developing. T.S.Eliot accepted his first volume of poetry, Friday's Child, for Faber and Faber, publishing it in 1955, and Watson received the 1955 Governor General's Award for it.    He lived in Paris, 1955-1956, as the recipient of a Canadian Government Overseas Fellowship. Here he was introduced to the theatre of the absurd, and in the following years explored this interest with his own writing and directing activities. In the early 1960s, Watson made contact with Marshall McLuhan and developed a growing interest in McLuhan's theories, culminating with their collaboration on the study, From Cliche to Archetype. Watson started work on his first major play, Cockcrow and the Gulls, in the mid-1950s, and it was first performed at the University of Alberta's Studio Theatre in March 1962. Studio Theatre, where Thomas Peacocke and Gordon Peacock were both associated, was an important venue for the production of Watson plays.    During the 1960s Watson had his most prolific period of playwriting; Trial of Corporal Adam was produced in 1963; Wail for two Pedestals in 1964; and Let's murder clytemnestra according to the principles of marshall mcluhan in 1969. A play for Canada's centennial, O holy ghost, dip your finger in the blood of Canada, and write, I love you was produced in 1967. (For a complete listing of Watson's works, please refer to the Watson biography file at the University of Alberta Archives) During the 1970s, Watson concentrated on writing poetry, and his second volume of poetry, The Sorrowful Canadians and Other Poems was published in 1972. This volume of poetry experimented with using different typefaces and repetitions, and Watson later introduced Number-grid Verse in a volume titled I Begin With Counting. Number-grid verse involved a configuration that combines numerals and words juxtaposed on the page; this form allowed Watson to score poetry for oral performance by several voices. A second volume of number-grid verse, Mass on Cowback, was published in 1982.    The 1980s also saw Watson return to writing for the stage; The Woman Taken in Adultery, a short play, was performed at the Edmonton Fringe Festival in 1987 and a major play trilogy, Gramsci x 3 was produced by Studio Theatre in 1986. The number-grid verse concept was applied to these later plays as well. Wilfred Watson also wrote some short stories, essays, and a novel, although a lot of what he wrote was never published. In her article on Wilfred Watson for the Gale Dictionary of Literary Biography, Diane Bessai writes: ""Wilfred Watson, playwright, poet, teacher, and literary theorist, has steadily conducted a one-man revolution in Canadian letters from the 1950s to the present.""(pp 382)"	Wilfred Watson was born in England in 1911 and immigrated to Canada with his family at the age of fifteen, settling in Duncan, British Columbia. Watson earned a B.A. in English literature from the University of British Columbia (1943); served with the Canadian navy during the Second World War; and continued his education after the war at the University of Toronto (receiving an M.A. in 1946 and a Ph.D. in 1951).

Person	Romanet, Louis Auguste	1880-08-14 - 1.16.1964	"Louis Auguste Romanet was born in St. Nazaire en Royans in the south of France on 14 August 1880. At the age of 23 he resigned his commission as a cadet-lieutenant in the 144th Infantry Regiment to seek adventure in North America. He joined the French fur trading company, Revillon Freres which was opening trading posts in Labrador, Northern Quebec and the east coast of Hudson's Bay; and was sent by steamer from Quebec City to Ungava. Romanet had wished for adventure and found it on this first journey. There were no accurate charts of the North Atlantic coasts and Arctic waters and the steamer encountered uncharted shoals and rocks, as well as gales, blizzards, and icebergs before she reached her destination. A dwelling house, store and warehouse were constructed by the Revillon employees on the Koksoak River near the Hudsons Bay Companys post at Fort Chimo. When the steamer ""Stord"" returned to England and France on October 20, 1903, the chief trader, his wife and two junior traders, one of them Louis Romanet, were left to manage Revillons first trading post in Northern Canada   Romanet kept journals of his trip to the New World and of his first winter in Northern Canada, in which he described in detail the strange new people, environments, realities and experiences. During his years at the Ungava post he made many trips throughout the province of Quebec keeping in touch with other Revillon posts and the Eskimo and Indian trappers and hunters. He met the daughter of another trader on one of his journeys and they were married in 1908 or 1909. (At the trading posts years were marked, not by calendar but by the arrivals and departures of the supply steamer, so it is difficult for an outsider to discover the exact dates of events.) A daughter was born to the Romanets at the Ungava post.   In 1916 Romanet joined the Hudsons Bay Company as an inspector. At that same time news of the war in Europe finally reached Northern Quebec, and Romanet left his family in care of the Company at Moose Factory while he rejoined his regiment in France. Upon his discharge in 1919 he returned to Canada and began inspection visits throughout Northern Canada from Hudsons Bay to the Pacific Ocean.   After joining the Hudsons Bay Company, Romanet began submitting reports in English, which he had learned more or less efficiently, through his contacts with English-speaking traders and natives. His later reports and the manuscripts of his books show great facility with the language, albeit his secretaries weeded out the French idioms that still appeared in his writing. In 1920 the Hudsons Bay Company marked its 250th anniversary with an essay competition among its employees. Romanet won the contest and $1000.00 prize money.   In 1923,Romanet was promoted from general inspector to district manager of the Athabasca and Mackenzie River Districts and general manager of the Alberta and Arctic Transportation Company. He was responsible for the operation of all the fur trading posts in the two districts and for the Hudsons Bay Company's river transportation craft: stern-wheelers, barges, and motor launches. With headquarters in Edmonton, his office operated out of Peace River to posts above Fort Vermillion and out of Waterways Fort McMurray to Aklavik. He remained district manager until he left the employ of the Hudsons Bay Company in October, 1930.   A meeting with Lowell Thomas in Edmonton, resulted in that author taking over the manuscripts on Romanets autobiography which was published by Thomas in 1932 as Kabluk of the Eskimo. Romanet described the book in a letter to Captain Thierry Mallet of Revillon Freres:   What concerns the Eskimo and the Arctic was taken from my MS. What concerns myself was gathered by Mr. Thomas during my stay at his home in Pawling, N.Y., or drawn from his imagination in certain cases. The events he described to Thomas were ""doctored up and magnified by him, to please the public which he knows so well."""	Fur trader, Author, 1880-1964.  L.A. Romanet came to Canada from France in 1903 as an employee of the fur trading company Revillon Freres.  He began his career at their Ungava post in northern Quebec.  In 1916 he joined the Hudson's Bay Company as an inspector; by 1923 he was sent to Edmonton to be district manager for the Athabasca and Mackenzie River Districts and general manager of the Alberta and Arctic Transportation Company.  In the latter post he had charge of all the Company's river and lake paddlewheel steamboats in the north.  After he left the Company in 1930 Mr. Romanet was employed at various times as an agent for North Star Oil Company, Abasand Oils Ltd (1937-1941) and as an inspector for the Northwest Service Command during World War II.	romanet-louis-auguste.xml
Person	Burgess, Cecil Scott	1870 - 11.12.1971	Cecil Scott Burgess was born in Mumbai, India in 1870, where his father, James Burgess, was Director of the Archeological Survey. The Burgess family returned to Edinburgh, Scotland the following year. Between the years 1887 and 1891 Burgess studied at the Royal High School in Edinburgh. He graduated with a gold medal. Burgess then studied architecture as an articled pupil to Sir George Washington Browne. He completed a four-year apprenticeship, a contemporary British standard, from 1892 to 1896. After completing his apprenticeship Burgess was admitted as an Associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA). It was a typical career path for British architects to travel through offices and projects gaining a resume of design experience and Burgess was no exception; following his apprenticeship Burgess did architectural work in Edinburgh, York, London, and Liverpool. He also continued to refine his skills with European travel studying and sketching the notable buildings, designs and works of art across the continent. It was during one of his study trips in 1903 he encountered the Edinburgh architect Percy Nobbs in Italy. Nobbs was about to accept a position to teach at McGill University in the Faculty of Engineering. Upon viewing Burgess's sketchwork he encouraged him to move to Montréal where he would find opportunities as a draughtsman. Burgess recognized the opportunity and before the end of the year, he was working in his profession designing several Québec projects including the Boys Farm and Training Schoold at Shawbridge, Quebec and several Montréal homes. In Montréal Burgess began his lifelong public advocacy of the Arts and Crafts design movement through public lectures and study groups. He delivered talks at the Province of Quebec Association of Architects and spoke at such public forums as the St. James Literary Society and the Grand Trunk Literary Institute. Without a Phd, Burgess nevertheless delivered lectures and taught courses at McGill between 1909 and 1911. The courses Burgess instructed betray the Arts and Crafts school of architecture he subscribed to. The were weighted to art and history and included historical drawing, architectural history and decoration. Recognizing it unlikely he would become permanent faculty, Burgess's acquaintance with Percy Nobbs again resulted in employment. Nobbs recommended Burgess to H.M. Tory, the first president of the newly conceived University of Alberta. Through his architectural firm, Nobbs and Hyde, Nobbs worked as the principal consulting architectural firm for the University and Nobbs requiered a supervising representative on the campus to see through to completion the firm's designs. President Tory appointed Burgess Professor of Architecture in 1913. He was made responsible to superintend the design of university buildings and design courses for the university's Department of Architecture. Upon his arrival Burgess designed Pembina Hall and the original six staff residences now known as the Ring Houses. He was the supervising architect for the Arts building (1915), designed the south wing of the University Hospital, University Farm buildings and cottages and the Varsity Rink, the University ice arena (1927). As University Architect Burgess also designed versions of the University crest, furniture, and various items of ceremonial regalia for official University occaisions. In addition to campus designs, Burgess was the associate architect for the Edmonton Natural Resources Building (now the Bowker Building) for the Provincial Government, the Birks Building and numerous private houses, memorials, and small design items across Alberta.	Architect, 1870-1971.  Born in Scotland and educated in Scotland and England, Mr. Burgess came to Canada in 1903.  He was the resident architectural consultant to the University from 1913 to 1940, as well as professor of architecture.  He supervised the construction of the Arts and Medical Sciences Buildings and designed and supervised the construction of Pembina Hall.

Person	Pearce, William	1848-02-01 - 1930	"A son of United Empire Loyalists, William Pearce was born on February 1, 1848 near Port Talbot, Dunwich Township, Elgin County, Ontario. Following a semester of study, in 1869 he abandoned his studies in engineering at the University of Toronto to take a three-year surveying apprenticeship with Wadsworth and Unwing, a Toronto land surveying firm. During his apprenticeship Pearce worked on surveying assignments in the woods of northern Ontario. His apprenticeship inspired his life-long interest in natural resource and wilderness development and confirmed his professional surveyor's career.   Pearce's professional life divides into three phases: federal surveyor and administrator (1874-1884); federal advisor for western development policy (1884-1904); and western consultant for the Canadian Pacific Railway Company (1904-1928). He received his certification as a Province of Ontario Land Surveyor in October 1872. His professional career began as a transit man for H.D. Lumsden, a railway engineer for the Muskoka Junction Railway. He moved back to Wadsworth and Unwin in January 1873. The company immediately assigned him to the challenging Thousand Island survey project running surveys across open water and ice on the shores of the St. Lawrence River. During his Thousand Island surveying project, Colonel J.S. Denis, Canada's Surveyor General, approached Pearce with an offer to join his staff in the newly-created Dominion Department of the Interior as it began to absorb the vast North American regions of Rupert's Land and the North-West Territories.   The Rupert's Land Act of 1868 began the legislative process to transfer from The Hudsons' Bay Company to the Dominion of Canada Rupert's Land and the North-Western Territory; after two years of geopolitical negotiation the Rupert's Land and North-Western Territory Order admitted the territories into Canada in July 1870. In the following years, strategies to assert Canadian sovereignty and control over this vast region were foundation stones of federal policy. Pearce's professional career was intimately connected to these strategies. Ottawa began to manage the region with the Dominion Lands Act (35 Vic., c. 23, 1872) primarily directed at the parsing of resources and settlement of the Canadian Prairies. The next year Ottawa created the Department of the Interior (36 Vic., c. 4, 1873) thereby assigning a single department administrative jurisdiction over all public and Indian lands west of Ontario.   Following his recruitment, Pearce began his surveying position in the Department of the Interior in Winnipeg, in May 1874. He was responsible to progress with surveys addressing what was commonly known as the ""Outer Two-Mile"" claims. Under the Manitoba Act (33 Victoria, c.3, Canada, 1870) Metis land grants along the Red and Assiniboine Rivers included undetermined and pre-survey settlement claims. The Manitoba Act gave Metis settlers access to hay two miles beyond their defined holdings to feed their livestock. In the shifting settlements, squatting, and rampant land speculation, Pearce attempted to stake out these claims. The ""outer two miles"" question was not settled until 1877, and claims were not staked until 1881 (Dept. of the Interior Annual Report, Canada Sessional Papers, 1882). Following the ""outer two miles"" assignment, in 1878 Pearce moved on to locating township grids, surveying meridians in Manitoba, and determining the International Boundary in the Turtle Mountain area."	Surveyor, Statistician, Administrator, 1848-1930.  William Pearce apprenticed as a surveyor,  joining the Department of the Interior in that capacity in 1874.  By 1884 he was acting as the  Department's chief advisor on the development of the North-West.  Calgary became his  headquarters in 1884 when he was appointed Superintendent of Mines.  His position rapidly became that of troubleshooter, advisor and unofficial promoter for western expansion. He was assigned the  task of settling land claims, particularly those of the Metis and squatters.  Based on this knowledge,  Mr. Pearce prepared the official report on the causes of the Riel Rebellion.  During the next twenty years William Pearce was actively engaged in devising a number of policies designed to control the  development of resources.  These included the creation of stock-watering reserves, establishment of  the system of National Parks, initiation of irrigation projects and passsage of the North-West Irrigation Act.  In 1904 Mr. Pearce left the government service and joined the Canadian Pacific  Railway Company, providing expertise in all fields of resource development, particularly irrigation.

Corporate body	Workshop West Theatre		Workshop West Theatre was founded in 1978 by Gerry Potter, MFA, University of Alberta, with a three-fold mandate: participate in the growing new Canadian Theatre; provide more stage access for Alberta playwrights; develop playwrighting talent in Alberta.     As part of this program the Playwrighting Circle was actually in operation before the theatre staged its first production. In the early years, new plays were not necessarily developed for first production by Workshop West, but this practice changed by the mid-1980s, inspired in part by the success of Theatre Network in developing and staging new works. In 1985, Workshop West initiated a short-lived “Playwriting Ensemble,” of eight theatre artists. Over the next two years the ensemble worked collaboratively to produce new collective works (e.g. It’s Your Turn to Get Up) and to adapt stories from other media (e.g., Sweatlodge Tales and The Rich Man). In 1986, Workshop West unofficially changed its name to Workshop West Playwright’s Theatre, a name that appeared sporadically on programs and publicity for the next five years.     In January 1995, while on leave, Potter resigned as Artistic Director. His legacy includes four Sterling Awards for Outstanding New Play, two Governor General’s Award nominations, and one Chalmers Award. Among the important playwrights to have worked at or been produced at Workshop West during Potter’s term were Frank Moher, Brad Fraser, Raymond Storey, Conni Massing and Stewart Lemoine. David Mann, who was already serving as an interim leave replacement, succeeded Potter as Articstic Director. Mann continued the Springboards New Play Festival that originated in March 1995 as part of the new work development process.     Workshop West has operated out of several venues. In its early years, it suffered from lack of a regular home. It moved into the Kaasa Theatre in the Northern Alberta Jubilee Auditorium in the 1983-84 season, and operated from that space until the 1996-97 season. In 1996-97, one show was staged at the Kaasa; one at the Roxy, a co-production with Theatre Network (whose home is the Roxy); and two at the 3rd Space, at 11516-103 st. (the home of Northern Light Theatre). In the 1997-98 season, Workshop West moved out of the Kaasa completely, to produce out of the Roxy and the 3rd Space.	Workshop West Theatre was founded in 1978 by Gerry Potter, M.F.A. (Alberta) with a three-fold mandate: to give Edmonton a chance to share in the "explosion" of Canadian theatre; to give Alberta playwrights more access to the stage; and to develop the playwriting talent in Alberta. By the mid-1980s, Workshop West was staging first productions of works. In 1986, Workshop West unofficially changed its name to Workshop West Playwright's Theatre, a name that appeared sporadically on programs and publicity for the next five years.

Person	Harris, Walter Edgar	1915 -	W.E. Harris received his Bachelor and Master of Science degrees   at the University of Alberta and returned to the University’s   Chemistry Department in 1946 following his PhD studies at the   University of Minnesota. In 1974, he was named Chair of the   Department of Chemistry, a position he held until his retirement   in 1980. He specialized in analytical chemistry, gaining   particular recognition for his work in chromatographic analysis,   nuclear technology, and his introductory course in chemical   analysis. He played a significant part in the restructuring of   the General Faculties Council in 1966 and continues to sit on   University committees. He received an honorary doctorate from   the University of Alberta in 1991.	Walter Edgar Harris B.Sc., M.Sc., Ph.D., D.Sc. (Hon.) was a distinguished Analytical Chemist, respected Professor of Chemistry and expert adviser in the field of chemistry. He was a leader in the development of analytical chemistry education in Canada, and a key member of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Alberta. During Harris’ career he published over one hundred publications in scholarly journals along with seven books. Harris has been awarded various honours for his work including; the 1969 Fisher Scientific Lecture Award and the prestigious Member of the Order of Canada. Walter Harris was born June 9, 1915 in Wetaskiwin, Alberta and raised on a farm in the nearby Gwynn Valley. Walter Harris had an older brother, Raymond, and two younger brothers, Jim and Gordon. During his early years his parents, Emma and Ernest, tried to instill within him the value of education. They sent him to Nashville School and Wetaskiwin High School from 1919 to 1934. A turning point came in his life when his grade ten teacher inspired him to pursue academics in university. Walter Harris achieved his educational goal receiving an Honours Bachelor of Science degree in 1938 and Master of Science degree in 1939 from the University of Alberta. Harris’ doctoral studies were completed at the University of Minnesota under the renowned analytical chemist I.M. Kolthoff. While researching his thesis on the polarography of uranium he was selected to work on the US Government Synthetic Rubber Program. This 1943 to 1946 project was a critical component of the war effort. Harris’ research component was to study the role of the mercaptans (thiols) in polymerization. For this work he developed an apparatus for amperometric titration that assisted in the analysis of small amounts of mercaptan. This apparatus measured the electrical currents produced by the point of a chemical reaction. Harris’ work in the program culminated in a paper, with I.M. Kolthoff on the use of amperometry for the determination of mercaptans in rubber formulations. During his Ph.D he met his future wife Phyllis, a graduate student in the public health field. She was very supportive of his career and even edited much of his writing. They were married on June 14, 1942 and had two children, Margaret and Bill. In 1946 Walter Harris joined the staff at the University of Alberta leading to a lifelong connection to the University. Harris’ first years focused on teaching, with heavy course loads and an overflow of post-war students. In the 1950’s additional professors were appointed to allow for more research opportunities across the department. In 1957, Harris went on sabbatical to complete research in hot atom studies with radio bromine. This work was completed with the Atomic Energy of Canada Limited at Chalk River Nuclear Laboratories. His research lead to a significant portion of his life's work on programmed temperature gas chromatography, which is the use of gas to separate compounds for analysis. This work culminated in the book “Programmed Temperature Gas Chromatography” written with Harry Habgood. When Harris returned to the University of Alberta, other North American Universities were closing or minimizing their analytical chemistry programs. Harris’ dedication to modernization made the program successful. He emphasized excellence in teaching and research practices, devoting time to perfecting experiments and lectures. Harris upheld conditions under which the highest standards could be achieved. Notably, his Chemistry 312 “Quantitative Analysis” course was influential to chemist graduates in the University of Alberta program, having taught them key research skills. Harris’ extraordinary efforts renewed the Analytical Chemistry program at the University of Alberta making it the best in Canada and among the best in North America. Harris published over one hundred articles in scholarly journals and wrote seven books independently or collaboratively with colleagues. Throughout his career, Dr Harris was involved in a variety of research interests including: uranium, synthetic rubber, amperometric titrations, hot atom chemistry, gas chromatography, chemistry education, academic reviews, and application of scientific methods to health risk assessments of radiation, as well as chemical and environmental contaminants. One of his greatest undertakings in chemistry education was the second edition of “Chemical Analysis”, a fundamental work for Analytical Chemistry. Written with H Laitinen, this book took thirty-six months to complete and greatly advanced the profile of the Analytical Chemistry Department at the University of Alberta. Another contribution to chemistry education was the publication with Ron Kratochvil, “Chemical Analysis, An Intensive Introduction to Modern Analysis,” which was a laboratory textbook that helped to modernize the teaching of analytical chemistry. Walter Harris’ served as the Chairman of the Department of Chemistry from 1974-1978. He focused on increasing faculty published research and tried to facilitate an open environment. Harris’ officially retired in 1980 but remained a continual presence at the University with the status of Professor Emeritus. After retirement in 1980 Harris’ remained busy serving on several committees. He was the Chairman of the President’s Advisory Committee on Academic review for fourteen years. This body examined academic and administrative units on campus to make recommendations for improvements. Harris worked for the Technical Advisory Committee from 1983 to 1997, which served as a consulting body on Nuclear Fuel Waste for the crown corporation Atomic Energy of Canada Limited. He was also part of the Alberta Environment Hazardous Waste Management Committee advising the implementation of a hazardous waste treatment facility located in Swan Hills. Much of his hazardous waste work involved the assessment of toxicity risks, culminating in a book entitled “Risk Assessment.” Harris received wide recognition for his accomplishments in both teaching and research. He was awarded the 1969 Fisher Scientific Lecture Award and the Chemical Education Award from the Chemical Institute of Canada. Harris was presented with the Outstanding Achievement Award from the University of Minnesota and the University of Alberta’s Alumni Honour Award. He received an Honorary Fellowship in the Chemical Institute of Canada and the American Chemical Society, of which he was a longstanding member. He was awarded honorary degrees in science from the University of Waterloo and the University of Alberta. He also received the Fellowship in the Royal Society of Canada as well as an Alberta Centennial Medal, and was appointed as a member of the Order of Canada. Outside of his professional work Harris enjoyed golf, curling, and the card game of bridge, along with travel and long walks. Harris and his wife were supporters of Planned Parenthood Edmonton, an organization influential in changing the Canadian Criminal Code to decriminalize contraception. Throughout his lifetime he kept in contact with colleagues, friends and family including his granddaughters Martha and Glenna. Walter Harris’ family described him as “one of a kind,” as well as, “simple, winning and direct.” Walter Harris passed away October 20, 2011. The WE Harris Teaching Workshop was established in 1976 and continues today as a legacy through an endowment in his honour. The annual workshop is held to facilitate discussion on teaching analytical chemistry, bringing together chemistry professors, lecturers, lab instructor and graduate students. Before passing away Harris set up the Walter and Phyllis Harris Graduate Scholarship in Analytical Chemistry. This was to assist graduate students and give back to the academic setting where he lived so much of his life. He will be remembered for his legacy in academic excellence, as well as his strong character and integrity.	harris-walter-edgar.xml

Corporate body	Chinook Theatre			Chinook Theatre/Fringe Theatre Adventures began in 1978 as Chinook Touring Theatre, a theatre for young audiences. Founded in Fort St. John, British Columbia by Brian Paisley and Ti Hallas, its mission was to "open an archway to accessible theatre adventures by and for the community." Paisley and Hallas moved the company to Edmonton in 1980, scheduling tours all over Alberta from its offices in the basement of the Princess Theatre on Whyte Avenue., before moving into a renovated firehall on 83rd Ave. in 1983. This site contained offices and a 175-seat theatre that was used for in-house productions and rented to other artists and theatre groups. The Chinook Theatre produced a number of original and adapted works but failed to develop a strong local audience or identity. In 1986, its name was changed to Chinook Theatre Society. While its attempts to develop a strong local presence with its own works were unsuccessful, the Fringe Festival certainly did. Using a $50 000 grant from Summerferst, Chinook created the Fringe Festival in 1982. Borrowing heavily upon the structure of the Edinburgh Fringe, Chinook set up theatre spaces and rented them out to performers. There was no pre-screening and quality was mixed, but the Fringe soon became an integral part of Edmonton's summer. The original Fringe had five venues, but quickly grew and peaked at 14 venues in 1993 and 1994. Total attendance figures passed the half-million by the early 1990s but many of the visitors were attracted more to the ambience of the Festival than the works themselves. In 1995, reflecting the popularity of the Fringe, Chinook changed its name once again, this time to Fringe Theatre Adventures Society.	chinook-theatre.xml

Corporate body	Alberta Fitness Leadership Certification Association	1984 -		The Alberta Fitness Leadership Certification Association (AFLCA) facilitates the training and certification of fitness leaders and trainers in Alberta. Established in 1984, the association was founded by representatives of fitness agencies who were concerned with the consistency of fitness leadership in Alberta. The delivery of fitness leadership programs is through these agencies, under the guidelines of the AFLCA and its Board of Directors. The AFLCA is an agency-based, not-for-profit association whose operations benefit the represented agencies that deliver the AFLCA training programs. These agencies, in turn, represent their fitness leaders. The AFLCA adopted the guidelines put forth in 1984 by the National Fitness Leadership Advisory Committee (NFLAC). Performance standards were subsequently developed to recommend minimum competencies desired in the trained fitness leader. In 1989, the results of the comprehensive survey of leaders, trainers and agencies led the AFLCA towards the development of a new program model, which included more specialized areas of fitness training and more variety in courses for leaders to explore and agencies to administer. The mandate of AFLCA is to establish and implement specific standards and guidelines that organizations can follow for the training of their fitness leaders, to certify those leaders who have been trained and through that training have met the standards and guidelines established by the Association and to coordinate the standards and guidelines established by the National Fitness Leadership Advisory Committee (NFLAC) and to adjust these standards and guidelines to be most suitable for the fitness leaders of Alberta.	alberta-fitness-leadership-certification-association.xml

Person	Cameron, Alan Emerson		Dr. Cameron became acquainted with the University of Alberta through assisting Dr. John A. Allan, head of the Department of Geology, in the Kicking Horse Pass area during the summer of 1912. While he was completing his M.Sc. in Mining Engineering at McGill University in 1914, he was invited to become a lecturer in engineering and geology at the University of Alberta. He came to Edmonton that fall, and remained with the University until 1937.     The First World War interrupted Dr. Cameron’s teaching career, but he returned to Edmonton in 1919 after instructing in the Khaki University, established by Henry Marshall Tory. During the summers he made geological explorations for private industry and the government in Northern Alberta and the Northwest Territories. His explorations and surveys for the Geological Survey of Canada and for mining and petroleum companies, many times with the assistance of students from the Department of Mining and Metallurgy, included the areas of Hay River, Beaver River, Great Slave and Great Bear Lakes and Lake Athabasca.     In 1920 Dr. Norman C. Pitcher was appointed Professor of Mining and head of the Department of Mining Engineering (now the Department of Mineral Engineering); A.E. Cameron thereafter concentrated on metallurgy. He completed his studies toward his Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology during this period, receiving his doctorate in 1926. He was active in research as well as in field surveys, and served as Secretary of the Research Council of Alberta for ten years until his departure from the province in 1937. Cameron was also an active member of the “Murderers’ Club.” To the regret of the University community, Dr. Cameron left Edmonton to become Deputy Minister of Mines for the province of Nova Scotia. In 1947 he became President of Nova Scotia Technical College, remaining in that post until his retirement in 1957. During this period Dr. Cameron guided the College to full university status. Numerous honours and honorary degrees were awarded to Dr. Cameron.	Mining engineer, 1890-1977.  Dr. Cameron joined the Department of Mining Engineering in 1914, departing in 1937 to become Deputy Minister of Mines for Nova Scotia.

Person	Peel, Bruce			Librarian, Author, 1916-1998. Bruce Braden Peel was born November 11, 1916 on a homestead near Ferland, in southern Saskatchewan, and grew up on the prairies. He earned a teacher's credential and in 1937 began teaching school in rural Saskatchewan, and later in Saskatoon. But he had ambitions which required more education, which the Depression and the outbreak of war served to delay. Although unfit for military service because of his eyes, he nonetheless volunteered, and ended up painting ships at the Lakehead. After returning to Saskatchewan, he took both bachelor's and master's degrees in history, then went east to earn a library degree at the University of Toronto. Returning to the University of Saskatchewan in 1946, he was appointed curator of the Adam Shortt Collection of Canadiana. In 1951 he moved, with his new bride, Margaret (Fullerton), to the University of Alberta Library as chief cataloguer, quickly rose to the position of deputy librarian, and in 1955 was appointed "Librarian to the University." As a library administrator, he guided the growth of the University of Alberta Library from a very modest size to its present rank, as one of Canada's three largest research libraries; planned and developed six library facilities on the Edmonton campus (including the Cameron and Rutherford libraries) as well as the original library collection of the University of Calgary, which was a "branch plant" campus of the U of A until 1965. During this period Mr. Peel also compiled and published Bibliography of the Prairie Provinces to 1953 (1956). He served on seemingly endless library committees and boards, and was president of the Library Association of Alberta (LAA), the Canadian Library Association (CLA), and the Canadian Association of Research Libraries (CARL). In 1982, the year of his retirement, he was honored with the Canadian Library Association's Award for Outstanding Service to Librarianship, the naming of the rare book room the "Bruce Peel Special Collections Library" and later, in 1991, by an honorary doctorate conferred by the University of Alberta. He was instrumental in the creation of both the University of Alberta's library school and its press, and a member of the seminal Symons Commission on Canadian Studies (1976-81), for which he drafted documents on the role of libraries in supporting Canadian studies, and the need for a national microfilming project, known as C.I.H.M. (Canadian Institute for Historical Microreproductions), on whose Board of Directors he also served.  Mr. Peel passed away in 1998. He was survived by his wife Mary, daughter Alison (Nussbanmer), and son Brian.	peel-bruce.xml

Person	Wheeler, Anne	1946 -	Writer, Director, Filmmaker – Anne Wheeler was born in Edmonton, Alberta, in 1946. She grew up in Edmonton where she enjoyed exploring the country north of the capital with her pony. As a youth she enjoyed music and drama, taking the lead in her school plays and touring with a children's theatre company during the summers. Following high school, Wheeler pursued a B.Sc. in mathematics at the University of Alberta (UofA). She completed her degree in 1967. Upon graduation Wheeler travelled Western Europe and the Middle East. On her return she enrolled in a music program with the goal of pursuing a career in music and drama as a high school music teacher. Wheeler received her music teaching certificate in 1969. She resumed travelling and returned to Edmonton in 1971 after exploring more areas of the Middle East and Africa. On her return she began a Masters in music education at the UofA. During her UofA graduate studies Wheeler began to pursue her interest in filmmaking. She joined Film West Associates, a collective of independent filmmakers sharing a passion for filmmaking, a dearth of experience, and an interest in creating films about the West. After five years and several award winning short films, the cooperative started to dissolve. By then Wheeler was prepared to completely leave music teaching to continue filmmaking. In this period she worked predominantly with the National Film Board and in 1976 she participated in the establishment of the NFB’s North West Centre in Edmonton. Wheeler produced several films in her association with the NFB. These included Great Grandmother (1975), Augusta (1976), Happily Unmarried (1977), Teach Me to Dance (1978), and A War Story (1982). A War Story proved to be a watershed in her career. The film garnered many international awards, among them the Blue Ribbon Award at the American Film Festival (1983).    Beyond filmmaking Wheeler also found time to start a family. She married Garth Hendren and in 1979 had twin boys, Quincy and Morgan.    In the early 1980s the National Film Board (NFB) released all directors from its staff. Although Wheeler worked as both a producer and director at the NFB, she decided to quit for the opportunity of independent filmmaking. Her first post-NFB effort was A Change of Heart (1983), a film she co-wrote with Anne Frank. Produced for the CBC, it was Wheeler’s first entirely dramatic film, a new direction for her art. Wheeler followed this film with Loyalties (1985), her most critically acclaimed work. The work won several awards including: Portugal Film Fest, Best Actress; France, Critic's Choice; Quebec, Critic's Choice. It was also her first dramatic feature film. Bye Bye Blues (1989), Wheeler’s next film, is her greatest commercial success to date.    Wheeler moved to Salt Spring Island in 1990 and became more closely involved with the film and television industry in Vancouver. This was a time when Wheeler expressed difficulty finding funding to produce feature length films.

Corporate body	Catalyst Theatre			The Catalyst Theatre was incorporated in 1978, but began from Theatre for Social Action projects directed by David Barnet in the Drama Department of the University of Alberta. One such piece, entitled Drinks before Dinner (1977), caught the attention of the Alberta Alcoholism and Addiction Commission and the commission funded a provincial tour of the piece. Soon other social agencies began to make inquiries, and Catalyst Theatre was formed, with Barnet the acting part-time artistic coordinator. In 1979, Jan Selman, a M.F.A. grad from Alberta, was hired to be Catalyst's first full- time artistic director. Catalyst's stated objectives from the outset were to "promote and practice the use of theatre for public education and as a catalyst for social action." Topics explored under this mandate included alcoholism and drug abuse, juvenile crime, spouse abuse, poverty and teen suicide. Plays were performed in whatever space the sponsors or tour location had available.  In 1985, Ruth Smillie replaced Jan Selman as artistic director. During Smillie's tenure Catalyst moved away from producing pieces for social agencies and began to pursue projects of its own choosing. In 1990, Catalyst, for the first time acquired its own performance space in the Edmonton neighbourhood of Garneau. The new performance space, though small, became known for its experiments in cabaret theatre. During Smillie's tenure, the theatre also developed the Takwakin project featuring the writing and direction of Floyd Favel. Favel's works All my Relations (1990) and Lady of Silences and Requiem (1992) featured all-Native casts and sought to develop new images of and for the contemporary native. Smillie resigned in early 1996 and was succeeded by the directing tandem of Joey Tremblay and Jonathan Cristenson. To cut costs, they moved Catalyst into a converted warehouse at 8523- 103 St., and revised the objective of Catalyst to focus on theatrical innovation instead of social change. The new commitment was to "creating original Canadian work that explores new possibilities for the theatrical art form and the process through which it was created," to "exposing work nationally and internationally", and to "challenging the artists and audiences who participate in the creation of that work."	catalyst-theatre.xml

Corporate body	Technocracy Inc.			The Technocratic movement was started by Howard Scott, an American engineer, in 1919. In that year, Scott and a number of other scientists and engineers, impressed by American mobilization efforts during the First World War, organized a group known as the Technical Alliance to conduct a survey of the of the potentialities of the American Economy in peacetime. The group was renamed Technocracy in 1930 and in 1932, its basic findings were published. In 1933, Technocracy was incorporated in New York State as a non-profit organization with Howard Scott as its director in chief. The objects of the new organization were: to carry out on a program of economic research; to bring technocratic theory to the attention of the public; and to provide a skeleton organization capable of forming the Technate of North America in the event of a final collapse of the social and economic order based on the price system. From the beginning the movement disavowed revolutionary and political activities. Scott began touring North America and soon chapters were formed in many North American centres including Calgary and Edmonton. The movement gained strength throughout the 1930s but in 1940, due to its stated opposition to the Second World War, was banned in Canada. The ban was lifted in 1943 when Technocracy modified their opposition to the war and sections were re-formed accordingly. However, the post-war years, perhaps due to continued economic prosperity saw membership and interest in Technocracy decrease. Though, relatively insignificant the movement has continued on into the early years of the 21st century.	technocracy-inc.xml

Corporate body	Northern Light Theatre		Northern Light Theatre was founded in March 1975 as a lunch-time theatre, modeled after the programming of Vancouver City Stage. The four founding artists were Scott Swan (Artistic Director), Alland Lysell (Administrative Director), and Andela and Merrilyn Gann (Actors).     All were originally from Vancouver, but had come to Edmonton where there seemed a more receptive atmosphere for developing new theatre. NLT’s first presentation was Love and Drollery, a collage of Elizabethan music, prose and poetry, at the Edmonton Art Gallery Theatre. As this production finished, Lysell and Sean also performed Babel Rap, by John Lazarus, in the first program of Citadel Too (also known as Citadel II and Citadel Two), an alternative theatre program John Neville initiated to expand the range of the Citadel Theatre.     Northern Light performed its lunch program for the next five years out of the Edmonton Art Gallery Theatre, which the company had renovated with the help of a $12,000 OFY grant that first summer. The ticket price for that first summer was $1.00.     In 1976, Northern Light added two evening performances each week, so it could offer longer plays. In 1977, Frank Moher was hired as dramaturge, and the company originated a “Playwrights Unit” for reading and workshopping new plays, by such writers as Gordon Pengilly, Tony Bell, Ben Tarver and James DeFelice.     Swan emphasized development of a “house style” of performance, a “lyrical intensity” of presentation and developed ensemble playing in works such as Ten Lost Years and Six War Years.     Among the works that got the Canadian premieres during this early period were David Mamet’s Sexual Perversity in Chicago and Arthur Kopit’s Wings.    In 1980 Northern Light moved to an evening program of full-length plays. Part of the plan was a commitment to originating new Canadian plays with two such works to be commissioned each season. Also in 1980, as part of SummerFest, Northern Light began a summer rep company, Shakespeare in the Park, in a tent on Connors Hill, south of the Muttart Conservatory.     Accumulated debts of some $107,000 forestalled plans for the 1980-81 winter season. The 1981 summer season of four plays added to the debts, leaving the company owning some $130,000. The winter season, 1981-82 had to be cancelled, and Northern Light ceased the SummerFest season in the park.     In late 1981 as well, Swann was hired by Festival Lennoxville, leaving the company without a full-time artistic director. Swan split his time between Lennoxville and Edmonton until Janice van der Veen, from the Vancouver New Play centre, was hired in 1982. In 1983, after a 1982-83 season that was staged in a variety of venues, Northern Light moved to the Kaasa Theatre in the Jubilee Auditorium.     A massive fund-raising campaign cleared off the debts by October 1983.    The Northern Light season became a mix of established, contemporary, and new Canadian works, a season at times much like that of the Phoenix, with whom it shared the Kaasa stage (though Northern Light was more likely to put a new Canadian work into its mainstage season). From 1982, Northern Light also participated in the Alberta Playwrighting Centre, which it co-founded in collaboration with Albert Theatre Projects of Calgary.     By 1987, with the theatre having gradually lost audience, van der Veen and the Northern Light board parted ways, and Gyllian Raby was hired from Calgary’s One Yellow Rabbit Company. Raby’s preference was to explore theatrical form and theatrical image. She initiated a series of collaborative projects, each involving a writer, a composer, a designer and a director. The first such project was Treacheries of the Blue Angel, in June 1989.     In 1991-92, Raby voluntarily took Northern Light off Canada Council operational funding, preferring the flexibility of project funding. Budgetary problems arose that year when a tour of Blake Brooker’s Ilsa , Queen of the Nazi Love Camp was cancelled by court order in mid-run, because of the Jim Keegstra re-trial- Keegstra being a character in the play.     Raby resigned in 1992 to accompany her husband to Halifax. Robert Astle, formerly of Small Change Theatre, succeeded her briefly, before D.D. Kugler took over from 1994 to 1998. By late 1995, Kugler ended Northern Light’s period at the Kaasa to pursue production in “non-traditional theatre venues.”    Although Kugler first attracted attention in March 1995 for a production of Daniel MacIovr’s 2-2 Tango, a piece where movement is the main communicative medium he was highly interested in the spoken word on stage, including adapting poetic works. He carried on a play-reading and development program that took works from early reading through to full production.     Sandhano Schultze, formerly of Pink Ink Theatre of Vancouver, became Artistic Director in May, 1998. His early plans included continuing the play-reading series.	Scott Swan (Artistic Director), Allan Lysell (Administrative Director), and actors Angela and Merrilyn Gann founded Northern Light Theatre, Edmonton's first lunch-hour theatre company, in 1975. In its early years, operating out of the Edmonton Art Gallery Theatre, NLT developed a reputation for a "house style" of performance and "lyrical intensity" in presentation. NLT's first season presented 18 one-act productions, including musical revues, classics, and Canadian plays both old and new. Throughout the 1970s the company produced an astonishing number and variety of plays every year, showcasing the work of local playwrights, taking on musical comedy, prairie drama, children's theatre and classics. By 1977 NLT was presenting full-length versions of such Canadian landmarks as <i>Ten Lost Years</i> in the evenings, one-act versions at noon, and touring both versions across the prairies. Also in 1977, NLT hired Frank Moher as dramaturge and introduced a "Playrights Unit" for reading and workshopping new plays. From 1982 to 1988 under Jace Van Der Veen's artistic direction, Northern Light joined the growing number of theatre companies who did plays in the Kaasa Theatre at the Jubilee Auditorium. In 1982 NLT strengthened its profile in Alberta's performing arts community when it co-founded, with Alberta Theatre Projects of Calgary, the Alberta Playwrighting Centre. 1988 to 1992 saw deconstructions of the classics like Brad Fraser's updated <i>Revenger's Tragedy</i>, and the spectacular <i>Something Wicked This Way Comes</i>, a theatre-ballet adaptation of Ray Bradbury's science fiction novel. D.D. Kugler took the artistic director's position in 1994. He moved NLT off the Kassa stage and into "non-traditional venues." He continued the company's reputation as a promoter of local artistic talent. From 1994-97 NLT produced nothing but Canadian work. The 1998/99 season saw Lynda Adams returning as Artistic Associate. In his first season as Artistic Director, Sandhano Schultze was nominated for 6 Sterling Awards. NLT celebrated its 25th anniversary in 1999/2000 having established a reputation as an alternative theatre dedicated to development and innovation. That year, Northern Light Theatre won public acclaim for its productions <i>Wreck Beach</i> and <i>Alphonse</i>, which was nominated for two Sterling Awards. The first annual Halloween festival, Carnival of Souls, was presented in the 2000/01 Season. In its first year, the Carnival included the House of Screams, a theatrical haunted house; Urban Tales Cabaret, a Horror Film Fest; and the Kiss of the Dark Costume Ball. The 2000/01 Season also saw the appointment of Al Rasko as the new General Manager. Trevor Schmidt was announced as Northern Light's newest Artistic Director for the 2002/2003 season.	northern-light-theatre.xml
