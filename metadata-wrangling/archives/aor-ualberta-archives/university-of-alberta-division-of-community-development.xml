        <p>This interdisciplinary graduate program, which began in 1968  under the auspices of the Faculty of Graduate Studies and  Research, offered a two-year MA designed to meet the need for  people trained in the principles and practices of urban and rural  community development in Canada and abroad.  The program was under  the supervision of the Interdepartmental Committee on Community  Development, until 1976 when it became a division under Interdisciplinary Studies.  In 1982 it was determined that a need  no longer existed for the program, and it was discontinued. Coordinators: [1968]-1975 Glen Allenby Eyford.   Directors: 1975-  1981 Glen Allenby Eyford; 1981-1982 Ahmad Sami Abdel Mohsen.</p>
