        <p>Taking its origin as the theological department of Alberta  College in 1909, Alberta College (South) took advantage in 1910  of the offer of the University of Alberta of a free site for a  building on the campus of the new University. The building then  erected was known until the formation of the United Church of  Canada in 1925 as "Alberta College South", the theological college  of the Methodist Church in Alberta.  With church union in 1925 Alberta College South merged with  Robertson College, the Presbyterian seminary in Edmonton, the premises used being those of the former Methodist institution.  At first called "United Theological College", in the spring of  1927 the two college boards became one under the new name "St.  Stephen's College", incorporated by the provincial legislature  April 2, 1927.  Until the death of the Rev. Dr. J.M. Millar,  former principal of Robertson College, Dr. A.S. Tuttle of Alberta  College South and Dr. Millar were Joint-Principals.  Until 1925 the College provided high school matriculation subjects  as well as theological courses, and also a men's residence for  students.  Since 1925 the College has provided theological courses  only.  Under Dr. E.J. Thompson's leadership funds were raised for the  erection of a new theological unit for classrooms, offices and  library, which was opened February 25, 1953 (James Ernest Nix, Alberta Conference of the United Church of Canada, 1965). Principals, Alberta College South: 1903-1917 John Henry Riddell;  1917-1919 David Edward Thomas (Acting); 1919-1926 Aubrey Stephen  Tuttle.  Principals, Robertson College: 1911-1918 Samuel Walters  Dyde; 1918-1926 John McLeod Millar.   Principals, St. Stephen's  College: 1927-1930 Aubrey Stephen Tuttle; 1927-1930 John McLeod  Millar; 1930-1943 Aubrey Stephen Tuttle; 1943-1946 Alfred Dennis  Miller; 1946-1966 Edmund Jabez Thompson; 1966-1979 George Milledge  Tuttle; 1979-  Garth I. Mundle.</p>
