        <p>The University Archives was fostered by President W.H. Johns  (1959-1969) and Professors L.G. and L.H. Thomas of the Department  of History.  The Board of Governors approved the proposed  department in 1968.  The first archivist was appointed in  September, 1968, and the Archives policy statement accepted by the  Board in October, 1969.  Part of the Library, physically since its opening, and administratively from 1968-1975 and again from 1990,  the Archives was an independent department from 1975 to 1990.  It  received as its first acquisitions the historical photographs,  reference materials, memorabilia, and some of the manuscripts  collected by the Library's Rare Books Department, and 31.00 metres  of Presidents' papers, 1908 to 1960.  The Archives actively seeks to collect all permanently valuable  official documents made and received by University officials and  governing bodies.  It collects the records of University-sponsored  staff, student and alumni associations, the personal papers of  staff members, and audio-visual materials related to all these  groups. University Archivists: 1968-1987 James McPherson Parker.  Chief  Archivists: 1987-  Bryan Eldon Corbett.</p>
