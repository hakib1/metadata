        <p>The New Canadian Encyclopedia Published Ltd. Was incorporated in 1979 as a wholly- owned subsidiary of Hurtig Publishers.  It commenced operations on April 1, 1980 with the objective of researching, developing and producing a new Canadian encyclopedia by fall 1985. The Encyclopedia was the brainchild of Mel Hurtig, owner of Hurtig Publishers of Alberta.  Mr. Hurtig was convinced of the need for a contemporary general reference work on Canada to replace out-of-date texts then being used in schools and libraries across the country.  He promoted this project and sought funding to support it.  Mr. Hurtig was eventually successful with his request to the Alberta government's 75th anniversary committee and, in 1979, was awarded $4 million to research and develop the encyclopedia and provide free copies for 24,000 libraries and schools in the country and for every diplomatic post abroad.  All production costs were absorbed by Hurtig Publishers and defrayed by the sale of the first printing editions.  A Managing Director (Frank McGuire) and an Editor-in-Chief (James Marsh) were hired in 1980. Together, they hired the editorial, production, and office staff responsible for overseeing the production of the three-volume Canadian Encyclopedia.  A major subject list in the fields of arts, humanities, social sciences and sciences was drawn up and editorial teams hired to deal with them.  Each team consisted of a senior editor and an editor-researcher.  Contributors from across the country were contracted to write the encyclopedia entries, and consultants and a national advisory board assisted the editors in editing and evaluating the articles.  The finished encyclopedia contained some three million words in about 14,000 articles with an additional 1800 illustrations.</p>
