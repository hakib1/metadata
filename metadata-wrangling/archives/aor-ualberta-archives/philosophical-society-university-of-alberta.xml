        <p>The Philosophical Society was founded initially "to stimulate interest in philosophical problems by reading of papers, by discussion, and by reports on research" (Constitution, 1912).  By the second meeting this mandate was superseded by one encompassing all subjects.  The Society sponsored an essay contest in honour of its founder, J.M. MacEachran, beginning in 1944. Lectures were eventually co-sponsored by the Humanities Association.  By the early 1960s both associations began to work in concert organizationally, finally ceasing operation in 1970 due to a declining interest in their programs.</p>
