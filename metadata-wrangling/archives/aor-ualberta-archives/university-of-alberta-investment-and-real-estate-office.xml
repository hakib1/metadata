        <p>The Investment Office is responsible for investment of all funds not required for immediate  operating or capital expenditures of the University. These funds are of three different varieties:  cash and short-term balances; University-controlled funds which are available for longer-term  investments; and endowed funds which have accumulated from gifts, bequests and endowments, and  include the Killam Funds, the Endowment Pool and the Non-Consolidated Fund.  The Investment Office contributes to, and coordinates the development of, investment and spending  policies for approval by the Board of Governors (MAPPS 1986). Investment Officers:  [1976-1981] Danny S. Kanashiro; [1982]-  R. James Fleming.</p>
