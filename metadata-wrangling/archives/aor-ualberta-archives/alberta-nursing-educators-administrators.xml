        <p>On October 31, 1968, a group of senior representatives from schools of nursing in the city of Calgary met with the purpose of standardizing aspects of nursing education in the region without diluting the competitive sprits of the schools. The group agreed to meet regularly to discuss issues pertinent to the group and called their meetings Directors of Schools of Nursing Conferences. By 1978, the group had grown to include representatives from other parts of Alberta and the name was changed to the Consortium of Senior Nurse Educators (COSNE). Membership in COSNE was open to senior administrators of Alberta institutions with professional nursing programs and with the purpose of providing an opportunity for members to share and discuss ideas, act as a resource group, and provide direction to appropriate bodies in matters related to nursing education in Alberta. In 1983, COSNE changed its name to the Alberta Nursing Educators Administrators (ANEA).</p>
