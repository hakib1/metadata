        <p>The Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada (AUCC) was formed in 1911 and assumed its present name in 1965. Its members are Canada's public and private, not-for-profit universities and university-degree level colleges. Four provincial and regional associations of universities and some 20 national organizations representing specific academic or administrative interests are also members. A voluntary organization based in Ottawa, the AUCC promotes and facilitates co-operation and sharing among its members, and administers under contract scholarships and international programs. The AUCC also publishes a magazine, University Affairs, and an annual Directory of Canadian Universities.</p>
