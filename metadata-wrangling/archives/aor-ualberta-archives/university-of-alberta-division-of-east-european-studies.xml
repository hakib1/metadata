        <p>A committee on East European and Soviet Studies was established  in 1959. At that time it was an informal interdepartmental  committee within the Faculty of Arts which was structured to  assist in the coordination of the increasing number of courses on  Eastern Europe being offered at the University.  In 1960 it gained  official status and became the Interdepartmental Committee on Slavonic Studies.  Six years later the committee changed its name  to the Interdepartmental Committee on Soviet and East European  Studies.  In 1973 the Committee was transferred from the Faculty  of Arts to the Faculty of Graduate Studies and Research, in order that the Committee could develop a program in East European  Studies which would lead to the master's degree.  With the approval of the Council of the Faculty of Graduate Studies and  Research, the Committee became a division in May of 1974.  The  Division of East European Studies came under the purview of  Interdisciplinary Studies when it was established in 1975.  In  1982, upon the disbandment of Interdisciplinary Studies, the  division amalgamated with the Department of Slavonic Languages and  Literatures, to form the Department of Slavic and East European  Studies within the Faculty of Arts. Directors: 1974-1979 Metro Gulutsan; 1979-1982 Robert L. Busch.</p>
