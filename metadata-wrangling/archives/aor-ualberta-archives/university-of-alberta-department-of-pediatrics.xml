        <p>The Department of Pediatrics was established, and its first head and professor appointed, in 1956.  In the 1970s, the Department worked towards expanding its subspecialty clinical services through  the sharing of appointment costs, or having the entire costs assumed by other agencies, namely the  W.W. Cross Hospital, the Glenrose Provincial General Hospital, the Eric Cormack Centre, the  Royal Alexandra Hospital, the Charles Camsell Hospital, and the University Hospital.  It is  predominantly from this outside funding that the Department has been able to grow and achieve the  clinical expertise to provide the necessary teaching and research in child health and development.  In addition to its teaching and research roles, the Department has played a leading role in the  formation of the Northern Alberta Children's Hospital Foundation (PACCR, 1981). Heads: 1956-1969 John Kenneth Martin.   Chairs: 1969-1971 John Kenneth Martin; 1972-1984  Ernest E. McCoy; 1984-1986 Frances Harley; 1986-  Peter Olley.</p>
