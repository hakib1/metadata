        <p>In 1909 John M. MacEachran (Queen√æs, Leipzig) came to the University to teach philosophy. That year, three courses were listed under philosophy in the Calendar.  Four years later, in 1913, the first MA in philosophy was awarded. In 1933 the Department was known as the Department of Philosophy, Psychology and Education, until Education became an independent school in 1934.  The Department of Philosophy and Psychology divided in 1960.  At that time it housed the beginnings of Sociology, which in turn became an independent department in 1961 (PACCR, 1985). Heads: 1909-1945 John Malcolm MacEachran; 1945-1952 John Macdonald; 1952-1957 Douglas Elstow Smith; 1957-[1969] Anthony Manuel Mardiros.   Chairs: 1970-1976 Peter Schouls; 1976- 1983 Cameron Mackenzie; 1983-  W. David Sharp.</p>
