        <p>Political Science courses were first offered by the Department of Political Economy in 1923.  Dr. Henry Bertram Mayo, the University's first political scientist, was appointed in 1947, and was Acting Head from 1951 to 1957.  In 1964, Political Economy split into the Departments of Economics and Political Science.  The Department's primary role is to educate students about the nature and activity of the state and the conduct of its government and politics, the government and politics of other societies and the interaction of such governments, and about individual rights and obligations (PACCR, 1984). Heads: 1964-1965 Grant R. Davy; 1966-1969 Christian Bay.   Chairs: 1969-1972 Grant R. Davy; 1972-1974  J. Peter Meekison; 1975-1982 Roberta E. McKown; 1982-1985 Frederick C.
