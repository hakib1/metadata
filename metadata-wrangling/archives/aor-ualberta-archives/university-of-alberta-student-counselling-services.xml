        <p>Counselling for students had been the responsibility of  individually assigned faculty advisors from 1944 until the  creation of Student Advisory Services in 1950.  In 1959 the  service was renamed Student Counselling Services to reflect the  desire for counsellors' assistance to be taken as more than  advice.  Responsible to the Provost and later to the Dean of Student Services (from 1976), Student Counselling Services offers  vocational and personal counselling to students, as well as study  skills training and assistance regarding general academic  concerns, to students at or planning to attend the University.  A branch of the agency, Advisory Services Centre, explains appeals  procedures and rules of student conduct and provides emergency  funds and bursaries for students in financial need. Directors:  1950-1961 Alexander Joseph Cook; 1961-1963 Peter P.  Rempel (Acting); 1963-1976 Arthur John Bates Hough; 1976-1977 Paul  C. Sartoris (Acting); 1977-1981 Paul C. Sartoris; 1981-1982 Allen  R. Vander Well (Acting); 1982-  Allen R. Vander Well; 1987-1988  R. Fischer (Acting).</p>
