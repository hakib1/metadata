        <p>The Development Office is established to develop, implement and administer comprehensive  fundraising programs and to encourage and increase the level of private sector and in-house support  for the University.  It represents the University in all fundraising endeavours, arranges for and  negotiates the terms of charitable donations, accepts and acknowledges all donations on behalf of the  University and, in conjunction with the Comptroller's Office, handles the receipting and processing  of all charitable gifts and pledges. In 1967 the Public Relations Office assumed responsibility for fundraising. This responsibility was  transferred in 1969 to the Fund Development Office which was established in order to follow up  pledges received during the Three Alberta Universities Capital Fund (3AU Fund) campaign and to  service Alumni Association records.  Following extensive reviews of the University's public relations, publications and fund development functions a new Office of Community Relations was  established amalgamating all three in 1978.  Three years later the Fund Development Office was re-  established as a separate entity, although responsibility for alumni records remained with  Community Relations.  The unit's name was changed to the Development Office in 1986. Director of Public Relations:  1967-1968 Edward Vincent Hamula.  Fund Development Officer:  1969-[1978] Lorne W. McPherson.  Directors: 1978-[1981?] William A. Preshing; 1982 Donald J.  Duff; 1983-[1984] Allan Holender; 1985 Margaret Clarke (Acting); 1986-[1988] Hal Spelliscy;  1988- Pat Warmington (Acting).</p>
