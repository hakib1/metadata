        <p>The Meanook Biological Research Station (MBRS) was a federal geophysical station from 1916 to 1979. In 1979, 214 ha of land was declared surplus and was purchased by the Canadian Wildlife Service to create an NWA. In 1983, the building site was transferred to the University of Alberta and was developed into a centre for aquatic and terrestrial research.  The MBRS is a permanent research facility located 135 km north of Edmonton and 15 km south of Athabasca, Alberta. The station is situated within the transition zone of the boreal forest and the aspen parkland eco-regions. The NWA consists of 58 ha of regenerating fields, a 7.5 ha building site and 148.5 ha of woodlands dominated by aspen, balsam poplar and white birch. The location of MBRS gives researchers easy access to continuous and fragmented mixed-wood boreal forest, peatlands, wetlands, agricultural land and a wide variety of rivers and lakes. The mandate of the MBRS is twofold. First, to provide a well equipped field and laboratory base for year-round terrestrial and aquatic research in the mixed wood boreal forest and aspen parkland eco-regions. Research programs are encouraged from the University of Alberta, other institutions of advanced education and research, government agencies and the private sector. Secondly, to interact with the University of Alberta and northern Alberta communities to raise the profile of environmental research through seminars, tours, guided field trips, open houses and workshops.</p>
