        <p>The first Information Office was established in 1965, and later  expanded in 1967 to become the Public Relations Office responsible  for publications, public relations and fundraising.  The  Publications Office split from Public Relations in 1968, and the  following year a Fund Development Office was established, so that  by 1970 four separate offices were in place (Alumni, Public  Relations, Publications, and Fund Development).  During the 1970s several appraisals were carried out on the four offices, and in  1978 all but the Alumni Office were amalgamated into a new Office  of Community Relations. The Fund Development Office separated  again in 1981.  The office was renamed Public Affairs in 1986.  The records reflect the Office's chief roles as the central public  relations unit providing media and community relations services,  publications, public relations consultation services for academic and administrative units as well as committees, and graphic design  services (PACCR, 1984). Information Officers, Public Relations:  1963-1966 Margaret  Richards; 1966 F. William Samis; 1970-1973 F. William Samis;  [1970-1978] Barbara LaCroix. Directors: 1967-1970 Edward Vincent  Hamula; 1978-1980 William A. Preshing; 1980-1982 Theresa P.  Papirnik; 1982-1988 Charles A. "Al" Squibb; 1988- Margaret  Clarke.</p>
