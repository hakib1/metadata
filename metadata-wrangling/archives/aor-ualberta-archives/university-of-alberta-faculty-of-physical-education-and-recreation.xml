        <p>Sports teams and organized physical training were part of the University√æs activities from its  beginning in 1908.  Formal instruction in this discipline originated in the Department of Physical  Education in the Faculty of Education (1945-1954), which became a School (1954) and finally a  Faculty (1964) of Physical Education, the first such institution in the Commonwealth. The Faculty  offers undergraduate degrees in physical education (BPE) and recreation administration (BA, Rec.  Admin.) as well as teacher training in conjunction with the Faculty of Education.  Along with  supporting academic endeavours through graduate studies and research, the Faculty administers intramural and recreational programs on campus and acts as an advisor for intercollegiate athletics.  Currently the Faculty is comprised of the Departments of Physical Education and Sports Studies,  Recreation and Leisure Studies, and Athletics. Heads: 1945-1954 Maurice Lewis "Maury" Van Vliet.   Directors: 1954-1964 Maurice Lewis  "Maury" VanVliet.   Deans: 1964-1975 Maurice Lewis "Maury" VanVliet; 1975-1976 Herbert John  McLachlin (Acting); 1976-1981 Herbert John McLachlin; 1981-1990 Robert Gerald  Glassford; [1990]-  E. Jane Watkinson.</p>
