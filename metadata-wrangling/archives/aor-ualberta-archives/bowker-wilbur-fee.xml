        <p>Lawyer, Law School Dean, Author, Member of the Order of Canada, 1910-1999. Wilbur Fee Bowker, O.C., L.L.M., L.L.D., Q.C., was born in 1910 in Ponoka, Alberta and received his early schooling there. He then attended the University of Alberta and graduated with a degree in Arts and Law in 1932. Upon graduation, Mr. Bowker entered the Edmonton Legal Firm of Milner Steele and practiced law for the next ten years. In 1942, he left Milner Steele and entered the Royal Canadian Army. Though Mr. Bowker was already commissioned as a lieutenant, he chose to enter the army as a private. During the next three years he would be promoted and returned to civilian life in 1945 as a captain.  Upon returning to Edmonton, Mr. Bowker was asked by then University of Alberta President Dr. Robert Newton to leave private practice and head the University's Law faculty. Though he initially intended to stay only one year, Mr. Bowker soon realized a passion for Legal Education and remained at the Faculty for 23 years (20 as dean- 1948-1968). In 1968 he resigned his position as dean when he was appointed Director of the Institute of Law Research and Reform at the University of Alberta, a position he held until his retirement in 1975. Over the years Mr. Bowker published many articles on legal issues, many of which can be found in A consolidation of fifty years of legal writings, 1938-1988 (University of Alberta Law Faculty, 1989), a compilation of his writings collected by his Marjorie. Over the years, Mr. Bowker received many honours including the Order of Canada in 1990. Additionally, as a symbol of the importance of Dr. Bowker's contribution to the Alberta Legal Community, in 1981 the Alberta Headquarters of the Attorney General's Department was named the Bowker building. Upon retirement he devoted his time to writing a history of the Alberta legal profession from 1670-1905. However, Mr. Bowker became ill in 1995 and was unable to complete the project. Mr. Bowker passed away in 1999. Mr. Bowker is survived by wife Marjorie.</p>
