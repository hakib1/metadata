        <p>Family Studies offers teaching and research on the family of the  past and the present.  Undergraduates may choose a general home  economics route or family studies route, both of which include a  work experience component in addition to coursework.  Master√æs  students may specialize in family studies, family life, education,  and consumer studies.  The department has become involved with  international projects, such as the Joint Family Development Center ("Brazil") Project with the University of Ceara in  Fortaleza, which aims to improve living conditions in urban slums. Chairs: 1970-1986 Dianne K. Kieren; 1986-[1989] Jason Montgomery;  1989- Nora C. Keating (Acting).</p>
