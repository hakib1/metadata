        <p>In 1987 University of Alberta Professors Emeriti Dr. Tom Nelson, Dr. Earle Waugh, and Prof. Sharon Brintnell, formed a committee to redress the absence of provisions that support continuation and development of the research, professional, and public service roles that the professors had begun in their academic career. The original committee, chaired by Dr. Earle Waugh, quickly built interest both within and beyond the University community. A survey was then undertaken that showed the formation of an association of Professors Emiriti was welcomed by a majority of the Alberta Academic community that would facilitate the individual and collective development of the University of Alberta Emeriti. In addition this association was seen as a vehicle that would safeguard their status and privileges.  With support from the federal government, the department of advanced education, as well as then University President Dr. Myer Horowitz, the Association opened an office in the Edmonton neighborhood of Garneau. The association began publishing a registry and newsletter, and in May 1987 the Constitution of the Association was formed. The association also sponsors several groups for Emeriti where members can meet, listen to guest speakers and discuss subjects such as the perils and opportunities of retired life, travel, and books.</p>
