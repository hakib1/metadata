        <p>The University of Alberta has offered graduate work since its  establishment in 1908.  Graduate programs were administered by the  Committee on Honours and Graduate Studies (1912-1915) and the  Committee on Graduate Studies (1915-1952).  A School headed by a  director was approved in 1952, and finally, a Faculty headed by a  dean in 1957.  The Faculty administers all graduate degree  programs, master's and doctoral, as well as postgraduate diploma  programs.  It implements regulations, approves applications for admission and graduation, and maintains a permanent record of  graduate students. Committee Chairs: 1912-1915 Adolph L.F. Lehmann; 1915-1936  William Alexander Robb Kerr; 1936-1943 George Malcolm Smith;  1943-1944 Robert Kay Gordon (Acting); 1944-1952 John Macdonald.    Directors: 1952-1957 Osman James Walker.   Deans: 1957-1971  Arthur Gilbert McCalla; 1969-1970 Henry Kreisel (Acting); 1971-  1976 John Ross McGregor; 1976-1982 John Forster; 1982-1983 Stuart  B. Woods (Acting); 1983-1994 Fu-Shiang Chia.</p>
