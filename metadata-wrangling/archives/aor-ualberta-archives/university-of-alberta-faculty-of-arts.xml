        <p>A separate Faculty of Arts was approved in 1962, and came into effect in 1963.  The combined Faculty of Arts and Science had become so large that separate administration had become necessary. Throughout the 1962/63 year a joint council representing Arts and Science continued to meet to organize two separate councils and their mode of operation.  Within Arts, there are three main divisions that departments fall into:  humanities, fine arts, and social sciences.  A number of Arts courses are also offered in French at Facult, St-Jean. The following Departments make up the Faculty of Arts:  Anthropology, Art and Design, Classics, Comparative Literature, Drama, East Asian Languages and Literature, Economics, English, Germanic Languages, History, Linguistics, Music, Religious Studies, Romance Languages, Slavic and East European Studies, and Sociology. There are three Programs:  Canadian Studies, Film Studies, and Women√æs Studies.  The Department of Psychology is described under the Faculty of Science. Deans: 1963-1972 Douglas Elstow Smith; 1972-1979 R. George Baldwin; 1980-1987 Terrence H. White; 1988 Thomas L. Powrie (Acting); 1989-  Patricia Clements.</p>
