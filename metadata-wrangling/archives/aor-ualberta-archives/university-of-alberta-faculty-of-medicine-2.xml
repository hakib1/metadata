        <p>The Faculty of Medicine was established in 1913, and until 1922 conducted a three-year  undergraduate program in the basic sciences, with students completing the final two years at McGill  or the University of Toronto.  In 1923 a full program of clinical instruction began and the first  Doctor of Medicine degrees were awarded in 1925.  The primary teaching hospitals of the Faculty  are the University of Alberta Hospitals which are located on campus. The University has formal  affiliation agreements with six city hospitals which actively participate in the undergraduate and  graduate teaching programs.  The hospitals are represented on the Council of the Faculty of Medicine and the Faculty has a representative on the governing Board of each hospital.  Some  training is conducted at hospitals in Ponoka, Camrose, Canmore and Red Deer.  Through an  affiliation with the Department of Health of the Government of the Northwest Territories, the  Faculty operates the Mackenzie Area Ambulatory Program.  The Faculty also operates "Family Clinics" in affiliated Edmonton hospitals to provide students with the opportunity to participate in  community health care.  The Faculty has access to the facilities of the University of Alberta  Surgical-Medical Research Institute. Graduate students are accommodated in the McEachern  Laboratory through departmental affiliations of academic staff members, and opportunities for post-  doctoral training are available.  The departments of the Faculty are: Anesthesia, Anatomy and Cell  Biology, Applied Sciences in Medicine, Biochemistry, Family Medicine, Health Services  Administration and Community Medicine, Immunology, Medical Microbiology, Clinical Medicine,  Obstetrics and Gynecology, Ophthalmology, Pediatrics, Pathology, Pharmacology, Physiology, Psychiatry, Radiology and Diagnostic Imaging, and Surgery and Clinical Surgery (Calendar,  1991/92).
