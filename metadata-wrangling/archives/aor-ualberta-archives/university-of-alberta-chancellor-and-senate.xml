        <p>By the authority of the University Act of 1906 the Senate was the sole governing body of the University.  Its first meeting, in March 1908, set the policy for the opening of the University in September of that year.  In 1910 the Act was rewritten, giving administrative powers to the Board of Governors and academic powers to the Senate.  A further revision in 1942 assigned academic authority to the General Faculties Council and brought the Senate's duties and powers closer to what they are today under the provisions of the Universities Act of 1966. The Chancellor of the University is Chair of the Senate, which has 62 members, 30 of whom are elected from the general public, 9 appointed from the public by the Minister of Advanced Education, 16 representatives from the University community, and 7 ex officio members (including the presidents of the University and the Alumni Association). It is the mandate of the Senate to inquire into any matter that might tend to enhance the usefulness of the University.  It is specifically authorized to interpret the University to the public; to require reports from faculty councils, the Students' Council, and any members of the academic staff; to receive and consider submissions from anyone interested in the University; to arrange for public meetings, radio and television programs and other means of providing and acquiring information on the University; as a consequence, to make reports and recommendations to the Board or the General Faculties Council or other appropriate body.  In addition, the Senate authorizes the conferring of Honorary Degrees. The Senate brings together the University and the public. Although it has little formal decision-making power, it seeks to stimulate discussion on issues of concern and to aid in their resolution.  It is a two-way link between the communities (Calendar 1990/91). Chancellors: 1908-1926 Charles Allen Stuart; 1926-1927 Nicholas Dubois Dominic Beck; 1927-1941 Alexander Cameron Rutherford; 1941-1946 Frank Ford; 1946-1952  George Frederick McNally; 1952-1958 Earle Parkhill Scarlett; 1958-1964 Lawrance Yeomans Cairns; 1964-1970 Francis Philip Galbraith; 1970-1974 Louis Armand Desrochers; 1974-1978 Ronald Norman Dalby; 1978-1982 Jean B. (Janz) Forest; 1982-1986 Peter Savaryn; 1986-1990 Tevie H. Miller; 1990-1994 Sandy A. Mactaggart.</p>
