        <p>The University began receiving gifts of historical, artistic or scientific value as soon as it was  established.  Dr. John A. Allan, first professor of geology, planned a museum of teaching  specimens and began serious collecting upon his appointment in 1912.  In time, custody of the  collections in fine and applied arts, archaeological and anthropological specimens which were presented to the University, became part of his responsibility.  Each department had custody and  maintenance of any gifts it received.  Record keeping was erratic and storage conditions  substandard.  Dr. E.S. "Frank" Keeping, of the Department of Mathematics, initiated exhibitions of art works during the 1940s.  In most cases these were travelling exhibits.  From 1947 to 1949 Dr. Keeping  was officially Curator of Art Exhibits.  This post passed to H.G. Glyde, and his successors as  Chairs of the Department of Art, who served as Curator of the Art Gallery and Museum.  There  was still no central Art Gallery or Museum or registry on campus.  In 1964, the Fine Arts Gallery (not connected with University Collections until 1968) exhibited in  one of the houses acquired in the University's expansion into North Garneau.  The Gallery was  renamed "University Art Gallery and Museum" in 1968 and in 1970 moved to Ring House One, the  President's former home.  The Department of Art ceased funding for the Gallery and Museum in 1974.  Until the appointment  of Helen Collinson as Director and Curator in 1977, special funding kept the unit operating.  In 1977 the University Collections Centre was established.  The University took custody of all art  and museum materials made, received or collected by any department or officer of the University  for the purposes of teaching, research, reference or exhibition.  The Centre provided the services of  exhibit assistance, registration, preservation, and some storage. Policies on acquisitions, budget,  and liaison were reviewed by the University Collections Committee.  From 1986 to 1990 the University Archives and University Collections were amalgamated.  In 1990  the Archives was placed under the authority of the University Librarian; University Collections became Museum and Collections Services, reporting to the Vice-President (Student and Academic  Services).  The major policy and acquisitions committees continue in their duties.  The organization,  Friends of the University of Alberta Museums, has been established to assist in fundraising and  liaison with the community. Directors:  1977-1986 Helen Fabia Collinson; 1986-1990 James McPherson Parker;  1990-  Janine  Andrews.</p>
