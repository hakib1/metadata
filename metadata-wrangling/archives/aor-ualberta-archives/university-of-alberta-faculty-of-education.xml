        <p>From 1906 to 1945 teacher training in Alberta was provided by  the provincial Department of Education at three Normal Schools.  The University established courses within the Department of  Philosophy and Psychology in 1911.  A School of Education evolved,  reporting within the Department from 1928 to 1934, when it became  autonomous within the Faculty of Arts and Science.  In 1939 the  School became a College, in 1942 a Faculty, and in 1945 it took  over all teacher education in the province.  The Faculty of Education provides professional training for teachers through its undergraduate program, which offers specialization in primary,  secondary, and post-secondary/adult education.  In addition, it  offers graduate studies for those seeking advanced specialization  in education.  It comprises the following departments ("divisions"  until 1961):  Educational Administration, Educational Foundations,  Educational Psychology, Elementary Education, Secondary Education,  and Adult, Career and Technology Education. Directors: 1928-[1939] Milton Ezra LaZerte.   Principals: [1939]-  1942 Milton Ezra LaZerte.   Deans: 1942-1950 Milton Ezra LaZerte;  1950-1955 Herbert Edgar Smith; 1955-1972 Herbert Thomas Coutts;  1972-1976 Myer Horowitz; 1976-1983 Walter Holmes Worth; 1983-  1991 Robert S. Patterson.</p>
