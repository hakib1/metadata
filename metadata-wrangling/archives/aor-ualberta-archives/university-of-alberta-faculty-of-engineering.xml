        <p>Engineering has been offered since the University's inception in  1908, at first as the Department of Applied Science in the Faculty  of Arts and Science.  In 1913 it was separated from Arts and  Science into its own Faculty of Applied Science, which was renamed  the Faculty of Engineering in 1948. The Faculty administers  undergraduate and graduate programs leading to BSc, MEng, MSc and  PhD degrees in chemical, civil, computer, electrical, mechanical, metallurgical, mineral, and petroleum engineering, and engineering  physics. In addition, it administers a cooperative program, which  alternates coursework with periods of paid, discipline-related  work experience with cooperating companies. Professors: 1908-1918 William Muir Edwards; 1919-1921 Robert  William Boyle. Deans 1921-1929 Robert William Boyle; 1929-  1946 Robert Starr Leigh Wilson; 1946-1959 Robert Macdonald Hardy;  1959-1963 George Wheeler Govier; 1963-1971 Robert Macdonald Hardy;  1971-1976 George Ford; 1976-1984 Peter Frederick Gordon Adams;  1984-1985 George Ford; 1985-  Frederick Douglas Otto.</p>
