        <p>The Department of Modern Languages was established in 1908 as one of the original members of the Faculty of Arts and Science.  At first, only two courses in French and two in German were offered by the Department's sole member and head, W.A.R. Kerr (who later served simultaneously as Head of the Department and Dean of the Faculty).  In the 1960s, rapid growth was accompanied by far-reaching changes in the Department's administration and structure.  The Department had split itself unofficially into Romance, Germanic, and Slavic Divisions, each with its own "Division Head."  The formal creation of three separate Departments occurred in 1964 (PACCR, 1981). Heads: 1908-1909 Luther Herbert Alexander; 1909-1936 William Alexander Robb Kerr; 1936- 1947 Edouard Sonet; 1947-1952 Francis Owen; 1952-1953 Dennis McNeice Healey; 1953-1964 Edward Joseph Hollingsworth Greene.</p>
