        <p>The Wauneita Club was founded in 1909 as a social organization for all female students.  It succeeded the club SIS (Seven Independent Spinsters) which consisted of the seven female students who attended the University in its first year of operation, 1908-1909.  The Wauneita Club devised its traditions and rituals from the Cree culture ("Wauneita" means "kind- hearted").  In 1929 the Club became a Society and was incorporated into the Students' Union.  As women became more directly active in University affairs during the 1970s, interest in the Society declined and it ceased to be listed as an active organization in 1973.</p>
