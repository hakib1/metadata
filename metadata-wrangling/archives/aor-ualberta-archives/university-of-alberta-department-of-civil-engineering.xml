        <p>Civil engineering was taught in the Faculty of Arts and Science  through the Department of Applied Science from 1908 until 1913,  when it became the Department of Civil and Municipal Engineering  in the new Faculty of Applied Science.  The Department received  its current designation in 1959.  Its objectives are to establish  excellence in its staff and in undergraduate teaching; to maintain  a graduate program that allows for specialization in one field  while enhancing research abilities and professional development; and to advance the profession through research and technology  transfer (PACCR, 1987). Professors: 1908-1918 William Muir Edwards; 1919-1920 Robert  Starr Leigh Wilson.   Heads: 1920-1946 Robert Starr Leigh Wilson;  1946-1959 Robert Macdonald Hardy; 1959-[1969] Stewart Ronald  Sinclair.   Chairs: [1969]-1973 Stewart Ronald Sinclair; 1973-  1976 Geoffrey L. Kulak; 1976-1979 Jack Longworth; 1979-1982  Jacobus P. Verschuren; 1982-1987 David W. Murray; 1987- James G.  MacGregor.</p>
