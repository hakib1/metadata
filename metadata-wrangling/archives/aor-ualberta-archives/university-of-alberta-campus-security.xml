        <p>Campus Security is charged with the protection and security of University personnel, property and  equipment, and has assumed responsibility for parking services at certain times during its history.  As early as 1912 a watchman was employed, and this position was maintained until at least 1952.  After that time it appears that maintenance personnel in various buildings served as ad hoc  watchmen and a City Police officer was assigned to the campus.  During the mid-1960s a Campus  Patrol existed under the purview of Physical Plant. In 1969 this group was replaced by the Campus  Security Force, reporting to the Vice-President (Finance and Administration).  The word "Force"  was deleted from the name in 1977 when a major reorganization of security procedures occurred  (PACCR, 1982). Directors: 1968-[1976] Charles A. Breakey; 1977-1985 W.F. Gordon Perry; 1985- Douglas M.J.  Langevin.</p>
