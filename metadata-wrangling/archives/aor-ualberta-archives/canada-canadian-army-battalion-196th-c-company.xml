        <p>The University of Alberta "C" Company of the Western Universities (196th Overseas) Battalion was drawn from the University of Alberta Contingent of the Canadian Officers' Training Corps.  After training in Camp Hughes,  Manitoba, the 196th transferred to England in October 1916 under the command of Hector J. MacLeod, professor of electrical engineering.  Due to its success in contributing officer cadets to the ranks in 1917 it was combined with another battalion to become the 19th Canadian Reserve Battalion.</p>
