        <p>As Household Economics, this discipline was attached to the  Faculty of Arts and Science as a department (1918-1927) and a  School (1928-1963) before briefly becoming a School in the Faculty  of Science (1963-1966).  It became an independent School in 1966  and was renamed the Faculty of Home Economics in 1976.  Home  Economics studies the physical environment and social nature of  people and, through its concern for improving people's daily  lives, examines consumer patterns and family dynamics, among other  topics.  Offering bachelor and master of science programs, the  Faculty comprises three departments (divisions until 1981):  Clothing and Textiles, Family Studies, and Foods and Nutrition. Lecturers: 1918-1923 Mabel Patrick.   Directors: 1923-1956 Mabel  Patrick; 1956-1961 Hazel McIntyre; 1961-1976 Elizabeth Empey.  Deans: 1976-1986 Doris Badir; 1986-  Eloise C. Murray.</p>
