        <p>The Extension Library provided a service to residents of rural  Alberta. It had a book collection of over 80,000 volumes which  provided intellectual, educational, and leisure reading for its  patrons.  Books were sent by mail to individuals and families, and  to small libraries and community groups.  The Extension Library  was also a major collecting centre for inter-library loan requests, and had access to the University's main library to  support this function.  The Library supported Extension courses in  a wide variety of subjects through its close cooperation with the  Adult Student Centre (Calendar, 1986/87). Many of the Library's  functions were taken over by the Province√æs regional library  system in 1987. Heads:  1913-1945 Jessie Fleming Montgomery; 1945-1956 Flora  Macleod; 1956-1957 Mary Isobel Dodds (Acting); 1957-1975 Mary  Isobel Dodds; 1975-1987 Sylvia Dubrule.</p>
