        <p>For the first two years of the University's existence President  Tory undertook the duties that would normally have been those of  the Registrar. In 1910, as the number of students expanded into  the hundreds, the first full-time Registrar was appointed.  The Registrar's office administers policies and regulations  regarding student admissions, student records and course  scheduling.  The Registrar publishes the University's calendar and undertakes an external role in high school liaison and in inter-  University committees on related topics - transfer credits, for  example.  In the area of student records and admissions the  Registrar has become responsible for tens of thousands of students  and courses.  This has involved substantial innovations in  computing technology.  Finally, the Registrar assumes much of the  responsibility for the convocation ceremonies that attend the  annual graduation of the University's student body. Registrars:  1910-1927 Cecil Ethelbert Race; 1927-1928 Ernest  Wilson Sheldon (Acting); 1928-1946 Albert Edward Ottewell; 1946-  1956 Geoffrey B. Taylor; 1956-1978 Alexander D. Cairns; 1978-  1979 Lynn P. Morgan (Acting); 1980-1984 William A. Blanchard;  1984-  Brian J. Silzer.</p>
