        <p>In 1967, the Board of Governors approved changes in the University administrative structure which were intended to decentralize the administrative burden and delegate broad areas of responsibility.  In that year, David Gordon Tyndall was appointed first Vice-President (Finance and Administration), responsible for formulating and implementing policy on finance and general administration.  Since 1913, full charge of the University's financial affairs had rested with the Bursar.  The newly created Office of the Comptroller, reporting to the Vice-President (Finance and Administration), assumed the responsibilities of the Bursar's Office in 1968. In 1985, the President requested a review of the Offices of the Vice- Presidents (Finance and Administration) and (Facilities and Services).  The Board approved a new structure in 1986, in which a new Vice-President (Administration), Allan A. Warrack, was appointed with an Associate Vice- President (Finance), Alan A. Rennie.  The title was changed back to Vice- President (Finance and Adminstration) in 1991 with the appointment of Glenn Harris. Successive Heads: 1967-1972 David Gordon Tyndall; 1972-1985 Lorne C. Leitch; 1986-1990 Allan A. Warrack; 1991- Glenn Harris.</p>
