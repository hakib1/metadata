After graduation he served in the British Armed forces in Malaya before immigrating to Canada.  Dr. McIntyre taught at the University of Alberta's Faculty of Medicine from 1956- 1990 where he specialized in the discipline of resuscitation.  Upon retirement in 1990, he was appointed Professor Emiriti by the University and the department library was renamed the J.W.R. McIntyre Library in his honour.  During his tenure at the U. of A., he published numerous articles and co-authored four monographs (with Akitomo Matsuki) including Learning and teaching tracheal intubation (Tokyo: 1994) and English writing for anaesthesiologists and other physicians (Tokyo: 1992).
