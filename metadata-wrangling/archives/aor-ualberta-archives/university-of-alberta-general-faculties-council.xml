        <p>As defined in the Universities Act, the Council (GFC) has the authority to direct the academic policies of the University, to provide a forum for the academic staff and to have general supervision over all student affairs, including discipline.  The General Faculties Council consists of the President (ex officio chair of the GFC), the Vice-Presidents, the Deans, the Librarian, the Registrar, elected members representing the Faculties and appointed members, including students.  GFC, subject to the authority of the Board of Governors, is the senior academic body of the University.  It provides for the granting and conferring of degrees, for the approval of courses and programs of study, and for the hearing of appeals by students and others from decisions of faculty councils.  GFC makes rules and regulations for the management and conduct of the Library and determines standards and policies respecting admission of students.  It may make recommendations to the Board on affiliation of other institutions, on academic planning, campus planning, the budget, procedures regarding the appointment, promotion and dismissal of academic staff, and any other matter which it considers to be of interest to the University  (Calendar 1990/91).</p>
