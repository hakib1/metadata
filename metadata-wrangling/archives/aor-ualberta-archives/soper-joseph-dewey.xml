        <p>Zoologist (1893-1982).  Joseph Dewey Soper worked as a naturalist with the National Museum of Canada (1923-1927) and led Baffin Island expeditions for the Northwest Territories Branch of the Department of the Interior.  Later he served as chief Federal wildlife officer, Canadian Wildlife Services, for the Prairie Provinces (1934-1948) and Alberta, Northwest Territories and Yukon (1948-1952).  As an explorer, he made corrections to the map of Baffin Island. As a zoologist, he was one of the first scientists to study the wildlife of the Arctic, discovering a new sub-species of ringed seal and the breeding ground of the blue goose on Baffin Island.  Three geological features on the island and several zoological sub-species were named after him.  For his contribution to the field of Arctic and Prairie Zoology, in 1960 he was given an honorary doctorate and research associateship in zoology by the University of Alberta.</p>
