        <p>First formed in 1917 as a school within the Faculty of Medicine,  the University's dental program became an autonomous degree-  granting school in 1923, and achieved faculty status in 1944.  The  Faculty of Dentistry trains dentists and dental hygienists for  employment in private and public health care centres, as well as  providing graduate studies programs leading to a MSc or PhD, and  facilities for research.  Students are given instruction and work experience at the University of Alberta Hospitals and at the  Faculty's community health clinics.  Within the Faculty are four  departments (Dental Health Care, Oral Biology, Restorative  Dentistry and Stomatology), each of which administers additional  divisions. Directors: 1923-1942 Harry Ernest Bulyea; 1942-1944 William Scott  Hamilton. Deans: 1944-1958 William Scott Hamilton; 1958-1970  Hector Robertson MacLean; 1970-1976 James McCutcheon; 1976-1978  Donald M. Collinson; 1978-1989 Gordon W. Thompson; 1989-  Norman  K. Wood.</p>
