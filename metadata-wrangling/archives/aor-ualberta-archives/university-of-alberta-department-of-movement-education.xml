        <p>Known as the Department of Educational Services until 1976, this department provided a program  for Education students wishing a specialization in physical education for the elementary school child.  In 1980, the Department moved its staff and resources to the Department of Elementary Education  in the Education Faculty for better service to Education students.  It was soon decided, however,  that the department in the Education Faculty was duplicating similar coursework in the Physical  Education Faculty with a loss of resources and contact from its old association.  Thus in 1983, the Department of Movement Education combined with the current Department of Physical Education to  form the Department of Physical Education and Sports Studies in the Faculty of Physical Education  and Recreation. Heads: 1968-[1975] Murray F.R. Smith.   Chairs: [1975-1981] Margaret Ellis; [1981] Murray F.R.  Smith (Acting); 1981-1984 Clive A.F. Padfield; 1982-1983 Margaret Ellis (Acting).</p>
