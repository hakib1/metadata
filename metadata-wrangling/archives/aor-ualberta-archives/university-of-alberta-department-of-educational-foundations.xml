        <p>This department is concerned with examining the history,  function and purpose of educational institutions, spanning such  disciplines as history, anthropology, sociology and philosophy and  incorporating the study of comparative, community, intercultural  and international education.  For undergraduates, it offers  coursework on the theories and methodologies regarding schools and  good teaching, and for graduate students it helps develop  expertise in one of the areas of study under its purview (PACCR, 1984).  The Department supports the John Sandercock Library, the  Centre for International Education and Development, and  publication of the Canadian Journal of Native Education. Heads: 1961-1969 Bernal E.
