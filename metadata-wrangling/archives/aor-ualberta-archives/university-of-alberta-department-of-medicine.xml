        <p>In 1923 three clinical professorships were established, one filled by Dr. Egerton Pope in  Medicine.  Pediatrics, Psychiatry and Preventive Medicine all existed under the Department of  Medicine for administrative purposes, until the early 1950s when they were established as separate  departments.  In 1956, the University Hospital and other city hospitals were accredited by the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons for teaching of post-graduate students, and by 1959 formalized  programs were developed.  In 1962, the Department was reorganized into a number of divisions,  each operating within the geographic confines of its own respective ward at the University Hospital.  By 1969 the divisions were; Hematology, Pulmonary Medicine, Endocrinology and Metabolism, Cardiology, Neurology, Gastroenterology, Infectious Diseases and Rheumatology, and General  Internal Medicine.  Clinical teaching units were introduced at the University and Royal Alexandra  Hospitals in 1975.  In that same year, the University Hospitalþs Department of Physical Medicine  and Rehabilitation became the Departmentþs 13th division; it separated to become a faculty division  in 1979.  The Department benefits from grants, fellowships and studentships from the Alberta  Heritage Foundation for Medical Research (PACCR, 1984). Heads: 1923-1944 Egerton Llewellyn Pope; 1944-1954 John William Scott; 1954-1969 Donald R.  Wilson; 1969-1974 Robert Stewart Fraser.   Chairs: 1974-1975 Brian Ralph Sproule; 1975-1986  George D. Molnar; 1986-  E. Garner King.</p>
