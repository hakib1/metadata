        <p>This organization for academic staff began as the Men's Faculty Club in 1911 but changed its name in 1959 when women were permitted to join.  In 1960, the Faculty Club merged with the year-old Faculty Common Room Association, and in 1964 it was incorporated under the Societies Act.  Its aims are to provide social and recreational activities for members and guests and to encourage intellectual association among academic staff.</p>
