        <p>To aid in the administration of the committees and bodies that oversee the University a central office has been created to ensure that records are maintained and that administration proceeds in an orderly fashion. The Secretariat is responsible for keeping the records of the General Faculties Council and its committees, Deans' Council, Chairmen's Council, the President's Committees and other bodies as delegated.  Prior to its creation each body would have been responsible for its own administration.  These matters were largely arranged by the President's office. Secretaries: 1969-1981 Margaret M. McCaughan; 1981-1989 Ellen A. Schoeck. Directors: 1990- Ellen A. Schoeck.</p>
