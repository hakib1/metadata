        <p>The Faculty of Arts and Science was the first faculty organized at the University, by a resolution  of the first meeting of the Senate in March 1908. Dr. W.A.R. Kerr was named Dean in 1914. In  1963 the Faculty was divided: humanities and social sciences were assigned to the new Faculty of  Arts; natural sciences to the new Faculty of Science.  Courses in the physical sciences provide a  core of studies for other faculties, especially Agriculture, Engineering and Medicine.  In the subject  areas of geography, psychology and linguistics it is possible to obtain a degree in either Arts or Science.  The Departments that make up the Faculty of Science are:  Botany, Chemistry, Computing  Science, Genetics, Geography, Geology, Mathematics, Microbiology, Physics, Psychology,  Statistics and Applied Probability, and Zoology. Deans: 1963-1965 Max Wyman; 1965-1977 Donald Murray Ross; 1977-1982 Kenneth B. Newbound;  1982-1991 W. John McDonald.</p>
