        <p>With roots in coursework offered in the University's former Department of Political Economy, the subject of rural economy was established in its own department under successive name changes: Agricultural Economics and Farm Management (1961), Agricultural Economics and Rural Sociology (1969), and by its current designation (1975).  The object of the Department of Rural Economy is to study and teach about the relationship between the agriculture and forestry industries and the general economy and the effect of this relationship on the environment and rural people; that is, the economics of farming.  It concerns itself with on-campus teaching, research, extension and community service (PACCR, 1981). Professor: [1960-1961?] A. Gordon Ball.   Heads: 1962-1969 Travis W. Manning. Chairs: 1969- 1974 Travis W. Manning; 1974-1978 Thomas Alfred Petersen; 1978-1987 Milburn L. Lerohl; 1987 William E. Phillips.</p>
