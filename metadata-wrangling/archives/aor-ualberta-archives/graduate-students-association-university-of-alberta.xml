        <p>Subsequent to its establishment the Graduate Students' Association (GSA) was incorporated in 1972 pursuant to the 1970 revision of The Universities Act. Through its policy-making body, the GSA Council, and its representation on the University's governing bodies and committees, it acts as an advocate for graduate students, assisting its members with academic, financial and other problems and communicating its interests to the University and the public.  It also administers the Power Plant, a social centre on campus which opened in 1978.</p>
