        <p>Successor of the Research Grants and Contracts Office (1969-  1982), the Office of Research Services (ORS) was the agency  through which University researchers submitted funding requests to  funding organizations.  It also marketed University research  capabilities to outside organizations and arranged technology  transfers between the University and industry.  To fulfill its  mandate, the office maintained a database of all research applications and awards, and the Director of the Office served as  Patent Officer of the University.  The office's two areas of  concern þ research funding and the relationship between university  research and industry þ were eventually divided between two new  offices, the Research Grants Office and the Intellectual Property  and Contracts Office, which replaced the ORS in 1990. Directors: 1969-1983 Gordon A. Holmes; 1983-[1990] Robert Armit;  [1990] Hugh Brian Dunford (Acting).</p>
