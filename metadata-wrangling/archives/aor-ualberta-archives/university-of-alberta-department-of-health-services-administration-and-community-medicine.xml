        <p>The establishment of a separate Department of Preventive Medicine was approved by the Board of  Governors in 1949/50.  Prior to this, instruction in this area was carried out under the Department  of Medicine.  A Department of Hygiene and Preventive Medicine first appeared in the 1952/53  calendar.  In 1954, the name was changed to Preventive Medicine, and to the Department of Community Medicine in 1966.  Originally, the disciplinary areas of Family Medicine, Ambulatory  Care and Health Services Administration were placed under the Department, but this structure  proved unsatisfactory and a review in 1977 resulted in these becoming free-standing divisions  responsible directly to the Dean.  A second review of Community Medicine, in 1981, recommended  that Health Services Administration and Community Medicine merge into one department to achieve  a greater critical mass of faculty, space, and budget, with differences in educational programs and  goals recognized.  The merger was formalized in January 1982. Professors: [1954-1956] Malcolm Ross Bow (Preventive Medicine); [1956-1958] Cleeve Russel  Amies (Preventive Medicine).   Heads: 1959-1968 Stanley Greenhill.   Chairs: 1969-1981 Stanley  Greenhill (Community Medicine); 1981- Clarke Hazlett.</p>
