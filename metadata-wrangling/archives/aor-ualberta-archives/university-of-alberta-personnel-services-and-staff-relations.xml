        <p>During the 1940s, the Bursar assumed responsibility for non-  academic staff matters.  In 1957 the Personnel Office was  established within the Bursar's Office, and ten years later it  became a separate department.  PSSR, reporting to the Vice-  President (Finance and Administration), provides advice, assistance and services to departmental administrators on all  matters affecting non-academic personnel, and ensures that  policies, regulations and guidelines are consistently applied  throughout the campus.  The Department oversees the operation of  six divisions:  Employee Relations, Employment Services,  Classification and Compensation, Information Systems, Training and Development, and Occupational Health and Safety. Personnel Officers:  1957-1967 Murray Stewart Cooke.  Directors:  1967-1976 Murray Stewart Cooke; 1976-  Brian Caunt.</p>
