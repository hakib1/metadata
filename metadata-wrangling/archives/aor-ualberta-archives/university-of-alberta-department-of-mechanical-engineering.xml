        <p>Work in mechanical engineering fell under divisions of the  Departments of Civil Engineering and Electrical Engineering before  its own department was established.  Besides preparing students  for a professional career through its undergraduate program, the  department offers graduate studies leading to MEng, MSc and PhD  degrees, and conducts research and technology transfers in cooperation with government and industry in such areas as  mechanics, dynamics and engineering management (PACCR, 1989). Heads: 1958-1969 George Ford.   Chairs: 1969-1971 George Ford;  1971-1975 James S. Kennedy; 1975-1984 Donald Grant Bellow;  1984-  M. Gary Faulkner</p>
