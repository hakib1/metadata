        <p>In 1971, the Board of Governors appointed Dr. Don Scott as the first University Ombudsman.  His function was to receive, investigate, and seek to resolve complaints and grievances made to him  by students and staff of the University concerning any academic and administrative procedures,  practices and decisions.  Typical complaints included problems with examinations, fee assessments,  grading, quality and quantity of teaching, drinking at games, and termination of non-academic staff  positions. In 1974 the Board of Governors initiated a review of the office, and it was allowed to  lapse with the resignation of the incumbent on June 30, 1975.  By that time other channels for  dealing with complaints and grievances on campus had been developed and improved. Ombudsman: 1971-1975 Donald Burton Scott.</p>
