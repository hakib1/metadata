        <p>The Department, as it now exists, was first created in 1965/66.  However, the University's  residences and food services have been an integral part of the campus since the first University  building was built in 1911.  Housing and Food Services' mandate now extends beyond providing  room and board to students.  The Department is an ancillary service department which reported to the Vice-President  (Administration) through the Associate Vice-President (Student and Academic Services).  The  Department is organized into five divisions: Housing, Catering and Conference Services, Finance,  and Facilities, and the Administrative Unit, all of which report to the Director. The Housing  Division is responsible for the welfare of the occupants of the University's six residence  communities and acts as landlord to the residence-related day care centres.  It maintains leases and  contracts and liaison with the residence associations.  The Catering and Conference Services Division maintains the dining hall, cafeteria, lunchrooms,  concessions, catering service, and vending machines; rents meeting rooms and guest rooms in the  residence buildings; and operates a conference management service.  The Facilities Division is responsible for the structural systems and for cleaning and maintaining all  the buildings, rooms, equipment and furniture owned by the Department.  The Finance Division  processes the Department's accounts receivable; develops and maintains the budget document;  prepares monthly reports and financial statements; and supervises the Department's computing systems and hardware.  The Administrative Support Unit includes the Personnel Office (a satellite of University Personnel  Services and Staff Relations), and the Office staff (PACCR, 1988). Directors:  1965-1966 Derek Anthony Peter Bone (Acting); 1966-1969 Derek Anthony Peter Bone  1969-1970; Jack W. Raven (Acting); 1970-1974 Jack W. Raven; 1974-1978 David B. Young; 1978-  1985 Gail G. Brown; 1985-  David A. Bruch.</p>
