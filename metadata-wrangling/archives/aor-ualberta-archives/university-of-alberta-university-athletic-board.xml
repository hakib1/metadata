        <p>As early as the session of 1911/12, the University of Alberta  established an Athletic Association.  In 1914 a Committee on  Physical Education was established which was followed in [1920]  by a Committee on University Athletics.  In 1938 a Men's Athletic  Association and a Women's Athletic Association were formed.  In  recognition of the need to encourage participation in extramural  athletics, intramural activities and physical recreational  activities and to assist in the administration of these programs,  a University Athletic Board was established in 1946.  By 1981, the Board included representatives from the Athletic Associations, the  students' associations, the coordinators of various athletics  programs and the Faculty of Physical Education and Recreation.  During its early years the Board was chaired by the Director of  Physical Education (M. L. Van Vliet, ca. 1946-1971).  The 1981  constitution called for either the President of Men's Athletics  or the President of Women's Athletics to be elected chair of the Board.</p>
