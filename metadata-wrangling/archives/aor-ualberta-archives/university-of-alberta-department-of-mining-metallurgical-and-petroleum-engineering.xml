        <p>With roots in the Department of Geology, these disciplines have  been taught in the Engineering Faculty as the Department of Mining  Engineering (1920-1930), Mining and Metallurgy (1930-1973) and  Mineral Engineering (1973-1986 - an amalgamation with the  Petroleum division of Chemical Engineering) before receiving its  current status.  As its fields of study are significant to the  economy of Alberta, it undertakes to meet the province√æs need for  experts and applicable technology by maintaining undergraduate and graduate education, conducting research and exchanging technology  and information with government and industry (PACCR, 1988). Heads: 1914-1920 John Andrew Allan (Department of Geology); 1920-  1945 Norman Charles Pitcher; 1945-1954 Karl Adolph Clark; 1954-  1969 Ewald Oscar Lilge.   Chairs: 1969-1971 Ewald Oscar Lilge;  1971-1979 Franz H. Vitovec; 1979-1981 Donald Louis Flock; 1982-  1986 Loverne Rubin Plitt; 1986-  Jerry M. Whiting.</p>
