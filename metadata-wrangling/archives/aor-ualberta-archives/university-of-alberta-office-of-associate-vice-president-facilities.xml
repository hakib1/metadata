        <p>During the 1950s and 1960s the physical environment of the campus began to develop rapidly and substantially.  To denote the importance that the Board of Governors placed on this situation, the office of the Vice- President (Campus Planning and Development) was created in 1967, to oversee and control all processes relating to buildings.  Campus Planning had existed as a function of the President's office until this time. The Vice-President was responsible to the President for: 1. forecasting of space needs within an approved academic plan and the development and implementation of a long-range building program; 2. planning of all physical construction on the campus and on all University- owned property, including the direction of planning and project architects and consultants; 3. developing an annual building program including renovations, alterations, land purchase and utilities; 4. property acquisition; 5. preparation of annual budget estimates for buildings, property and capital equipment; 6. recommendations to the Board Building Committee on all new construction matters and on capital budget estimates.  The Vice-President was: 1. chair of the Campus Development Committee and the Space Allocation and Alterations Com mittee; 2. administration representative to the Board Building Committee; 3. responsible for the activities of the Campus Development Office; and 4. liaison person with external bodies on matters concerning construction and building programs. The name of the office was changed twice (Planning and Development, 1970-1980; Facilities and Services, 1980-1983).  In 1983, on the retirement of Vice-President Ronald E. Phillips, the office was changed to that of Associate Vice-President (Facilities), reporting to the Vice- President (Administration).  The offices of Physical Plant, Planning and Development, and Technical Services continued to report to the new Associate Vice-President (Facilities). Vice-Presidents -Planning and Development: 1967-1969 Walter Holmes Worth; 1969-1974 Walter D. Neal; 1974-1975 Gordon L. Mowat (Acting); 1975-1980 Ronald E. Phillips.   Vice-Presidents- Facilities and Services: 1980-1983 Ronald E. Phillips.   Associate Vice-Presidents-Facilities: 1983- 1989 James Brian McQuitt; 1989- Donald Grant Bellow.</p>
