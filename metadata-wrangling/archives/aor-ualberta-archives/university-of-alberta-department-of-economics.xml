        <p>The Department of History and Political Economy was established in 1915/16, offering one course in economics and a moderate variety in history.  In 1920/21 the Department split and the new Department of Political Economy emerged, offering fourteen courses.  Political Economy split into the Departments of Economics and Political Science in 1964.  The Department has three main academic tasks:  to cultivate economics as a branch of civilized knowledge; to provide economics courses as part of the training in various professional programs; and to train economists as professionals in their own right through its graduate and honours programs.  (PACCR, 1981). Professors: 1920-1929 Duncan A. MacGibbon; 1929-1946 George Alexander Elliott; 1946-1950 Andrew Stewart; 1950-1957 Henry B. Mayo.   Heads: 1957-1964 Eric J. Hanson; 1964-1969 Walter D. Gainer.   Chairs: 1969-1972 Thomas L. Powrie; 1972-1977 Bruce W. Wilkinson; 1977- 1987 Brian L. Scarfe; 1987- Melville L. McMillan.</p>
