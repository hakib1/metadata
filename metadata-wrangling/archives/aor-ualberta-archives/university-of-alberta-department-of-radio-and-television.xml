        <p>The Department of Radio and Television was established to  coordinate and expand radio and television activities at the  University.  It incorporated Broadcasting Services (formerly,  Radio Services) which had operated since the 1940s.  Functions of the Department included:  technical support services  to campus including dubbing, equipment maintenance and loan  service; operation of a closed circuit television system;  production of video, film, and radio programs for broadcast on  local radio and television stations; documentation of campus  conferences, lectures and special events.  In 1987, the Department was disbanded and television became a  division of Technical Services, while radio was discontinued.  In  1990, production functions were assigned to a new Division, the  Video Production Centre. Directors:  [1946-1958] Margery W. Mackenzie; 1958-1967 Guy H.  Vaughan; 1967-1972 Henry Mamet; 1973-1976 William H. Jopling  (Acting); 1977-1987 William H. Jopling.  Supervisors:  1987-  [1990] Wes Denison.  Video Producers:  [1990]-  Don Spence.</p>
