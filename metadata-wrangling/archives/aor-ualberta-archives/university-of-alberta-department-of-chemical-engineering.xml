        <p>Chemical engineering courses were offered in the Department of  Chemistry from 1926 until 1946 when a separate department was  created in the Faculty of Applied Science.  Two years later the  department was combined with the petroleum engineering discipline  but once again separated into the Department of Chemical  Engineering in 1973.  The Department aims to contribute to the development of Alberta's resources and industry and maintain  teaching and research worthy of international recognition by  training chemical engineers on the undergraduate level for  professional practice and by conducting graduate, continuing  education, research, and technology transfer programs. Professors: 1926-1945 Edward Herbert Boomer; 1946-1948 James A.  Taylor; 1948-1959 George Wheeler Govier.  Heads: 1959-1969 Donald  Baker Robinson. Chairs: 1969-1970 Donald Baker Robinson; 1970-  1972 Frederick Douglas Otto (Acting); 1972-1975 Donald Grant  Fisher; 1975-1984 Frederick Douglas Otto; 1985-  Sieghard E.  Wanke.</p>
