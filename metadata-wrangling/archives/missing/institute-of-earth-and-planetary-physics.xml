        <p>Founded in 1970 with the aid of a grant from the National Research Council, the Institute unites  geophysicists in the Departments of Physics, Mathematics and Geology and meteorologists in the  Department of Geography.  The members of the Institute include academic and technical staff,  research associates and graduate students from the four departments.  Distinguished researchers are  invited each year for short-term visits.  Research topics in which Institute members are active  include seismology, geomagnetism, palaeomagnetism, plate tectonics, mass spectrometry, space  physics, and meteorological studies, including studies of atmospheric and oceanic pollution. Heads: 1970-1974 John Arthur Jacobs; 1975-1980 Denis Ian Gough; 1981-1985 George Leslie  Cumming; 1985-  Gordon Rostoker.</p>
