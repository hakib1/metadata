        <p>Chemical engineer, 1888-1966.  Dr. Clark came to Edmonton from Ottawa on the recommendation of President Henry Marshall Tory, to join the staff of the Scientific and Industrial Research Council of Alberta as research professor, based on the University campus. His specific field of investigation was the development of a practical extraction process to be used with the Athabasca oil sands.  He patented his "Processes and Apparatus for Separating and Treating Bituminous Sands" (the hot water process) in 1929. In 1938 Dr. Clark transferred much of his work and teaching to the Department of Mining and Metallurgy, retiring in 1958.</p>
