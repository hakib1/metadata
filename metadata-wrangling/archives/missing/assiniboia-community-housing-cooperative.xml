        <p>The central aim of the cooperative housing associations at the University is to provide low cost housing to students.  The Campus Co-operative Association was founded in 1967.  It was dissolved and amalgamated with Campus Co-operative Association (1977), which changed its name to Assiniboia Housing Community Cooperative in 1981.  In 1986 the AHCC owned five houses and ceased leasing property from the University.</p>
