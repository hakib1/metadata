        <p>Scott Swan (Artistic Director), Allan Lysell (Administrative Director), and actors Angela and Merrilyn Gann founded Northern Light Theatre, Edmonton's first lunch-hour theatre company, in 1975. In its early years, operating out of the Edmonton Art Gallery Theatre, NLT developed a reputation for a "house style" of performance and "lyrical intensity" in presentation. NLT's first season presented 18 one-act productions, including musical revues, classics, and Canadian plays both old and new. Throughout the 1970s the company produced an astonishing number and variety of plays every year, showcasing the work of local playwrights, taking on musical comedy, prairie drama, children's theatre and classics. By 1977 NLT was presenting full-length versions of such Canadian landmarks as &lt;i&gt;Ten Lost Years&lt;/i&gt; in the evenings, one-act versions at noon, and touring both versions across the prairies. Also in 1977, NLT hired Frank Moher as dramaturge and introduced a "Playrights Unit" for reading and workshopping new plays. From 1982 to 1988 under Jace Van Der Veen's artistic direction, Northern Light joined the growing number of theatre companies who did plays in the Kaasa Theatre at the Jubilee Auditorium. In 1982 NLT strengthened its profile in Alberta's performing arts community when it co-founded, with Alberta Theatre Projects of Calgary, the Alberta Playwrighting Centre. 1988 to 1992 saw deconstructions of the classics like Brad Fraser's updated &lt;i&gt;Revenger's Tragedy&lt;/i&gt;, and the spectacular &lt;i&gt;Something Wicked This Way Comes&lt;/i&gt;, a theatre-ballet adaptation of Ray Bradbury's science fiction novel. D.D. Kugler took the artistic director's position in 1994. He moved NLT off the Kassa stage and into "non-traditional venues." He continued the company's reputation as a promoter of local artistic talent. From 1994-97 NLT produced nothing but Canadian work. The 1998/99 season saw Lynda Adams returning as Artistic Associate. In his first season as Artistic Director, Sandhano Schultze was nominated for 6 Sterling Awards. NLT celebrated its 25th anniversary in 1999/2000 having established a reputation as an alternative theatre dedicated to development and innovation. That year, Northern Light Theatre won public acclaim for its productions &lt;i&gt;Wreck Beach&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Alphonse&lt;/i&gt;, which was nominated for two Sterling Awards. The first annual Halloween festival, Carnival of Souls, was presented in the 2000/01 Season. In its first year, the Carnival included the House of Screams, a theatrical haunted house; Urban Tales Cabaret, a Horror Film Fest; and the Kiss of the Dark Costume Ball. The 2000/01 Season also saw the appointment of Al Rasko as the new General Manager. Trevor Schmidt was announced as Northern Light's newest Artistic Director for the 2002/2003 season.</p>
