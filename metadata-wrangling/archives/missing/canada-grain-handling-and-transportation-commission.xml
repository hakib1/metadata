        <p>The purpose of the Commission on Grain Handling and Transportation (Hall Commission) was to examine rail requirements for grain producers, elevator operators and related businesses. Headed by Chief Commissioner Emmett Hall, the Commission held hearings and accepted submissions in agricultural communities throughout the four Western Provinces. Its final report, Grain and Rail in Western Canada was delivered to the Minister of Transport and the Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board in 1977.  The Hall Commission grew out of the agricultural industry's concern over terminals and branch line closures, and its findings resulted in a realignment of elevator and rail systems.  The  records were maintained by J.M. McDonough, executive director of the Commission.</p>
