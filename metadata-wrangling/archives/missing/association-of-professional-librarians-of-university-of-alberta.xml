        <p>The University Professional Librarians' Group, founded in 1960, was succeeded in 1966 by the Association of Professional Librairians of the University of Alberta (APLUA) which, unlike its predecessor, has a formal constitution.  Its mandate includes the promotion and advancement of the interests and welfare of professional librarians to provide the best possible professional service. APLUA also promotes continuing education and encourages an interest in and knowledge of the profession at all levels and in all types of libraries.</p>
