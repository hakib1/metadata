Smith was appointed assistant professor of Philosophy at the University in 1929.  Following a wartime leave of absence, he served as Director of Summer Session (1945-1949).  In 1949 he was granted a full professorship, and from 1950 until his retirement in 1955 he was Dean of the Faculty of Education.  He also taught as a special lecturer in Psychology from 1935 to 1950.  Under his deanship, the education faculty expanded its teaching program to become a centre for graduate study and research.</p>
