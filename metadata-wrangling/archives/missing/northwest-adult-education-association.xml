        <p>The Northwest Adult Education Association (NWAEA) was formed at a constitutional convention in Portland Oregon on February 21, 1966. The 77 founding members came from Oregon, Washington, Idaho, British Columbia and Montana, adopted a constitution and elected Mary Wallace as the first president. The constitution of the NWAEA states its purpose as being "to advance Adult Education by serving as the instrument of cooperation among the persons and organizations in the states and provinces of the Northwest engaged in, or interested in, Adult Education." The NWAEA allowed educators from a diverse variety of backgrounds with an interest in adult education to discuss problems and issues relevant to adult education in the North-American Northwest. The membership criteria was broadened to allow membership to anyone interested in adult education that was resident in Alaska, Alberta, British Columbia, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington, Saskatchewan, the Yukon, and the Northwest Territories. The NWAEA holds an annual conference, publishes a newsletter, and issues position papers on issues affecting adult education in the region.</p>
