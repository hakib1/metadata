        <p>Petroleum entrepreneur, 1904-1971.  Montreal businessman Lloyd R. Champion concentrated his attention on trust companies before becoming interested in the pilot oil sands projects at Bitumount, near Fort McMurray, Alberta.  In 1943 he formed Oil Sands Ltd. and from late in 1944 to 1948 he was associated with the Alberta government in building an experimental extraction plant.  In 1953 he formed the Great Canadian Oil Sands Consortium with Sun Oil Ltd. of Philadelphia; in 1967 the plant (by then renamed Suncor) went into operation. Mr. Champion sold most of his interests between 1966-1967, but his Oil Sands Ltd. was not liquidated until 1976, five years after his death.</p>
