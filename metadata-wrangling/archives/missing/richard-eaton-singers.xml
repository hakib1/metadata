        <p>Edmonton's premier oratorio choir, founded in 1951, was originally called the University Singers. It was renamed in memory of its founding director, Richard S. Eaton, in 1969. It has had a long association with the University of Alberta, as the Choir rehearses on campus and draws its music directors from the Department of Music. The Singers, however, have always been an entity separate from the University, drawing members from the general community and receiving funding from other sources. Directors: 1951-1967 Richard S. Eaton; 1968-1973 Alexandra Munn; 1973-[1982] Larry D. Cook; [1982]-  Leonard Ratzlaff.</p>
