        <p>The University Survey Committee was created in August 1941 by an Order-in-Council of the  Government of Alberta to conduct a comprehensive review of the University's affairs.  In particular,  the Committee examined the University's success in meeting the cultural, economic, and educational needs of Albertans.  Chaired by Harold H. Parlee, then chair of the University's Board of Governors, the Committee  submitted its interim report on January 30, 1942.  Committees internal to the University were  established to act on the report's  recommendations, thus the Survey Committee dissolved with no  further formal reports.  Many of the Survey Committee's recommendations were incorporated into  the 1942 revisions of the University Act, while others, such as the creation of an affiliated campus  in Calgary, were adopted later.</p>
