        <p>The aim of Project Canada West was to develop a Canadian Studies curriculum on urbanization for social studies programs in western Canada and to study the feasibility of decentralized, teacher- oriented curriculum development.  It was headed by Executive Director R.H. Sabey and its trustees included representatives of the teachers' associations of the four western provinces and the Universities of Saskatchewan and Alberta.  During its five-year mandate it supported the research and publishing of 14 sub- projects distributed throughout British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, with subjects ranging from Indian and Metis integration to rural-urban transition and Canadian urban government.</p>
