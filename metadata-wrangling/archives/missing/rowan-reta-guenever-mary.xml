        <p>Volunteer community worker, [1895]-1983.  Reta Rowan came from England to Manitoba in 1919, then to Edmonton in 1920, where her husband, William Rowan, taught at the University of Alberta.  Mrs. Rowan√æs interests were varied, ranging from involvement with cultural groups such as the Folk Festival Committee, to involvement with the Alberta Adult Education Society and with the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom.  It was, however, her work with minority groups at the civic and provincial levels that claimed most of her time between 1942 and 1967.  These included the Council for Canadian Unity, the Friends of the Indians Society and the Indian Association of Alberta.</p>
