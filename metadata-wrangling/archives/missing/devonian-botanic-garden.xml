        <p>Following unsuccessful attempts to organize a combined City-University botanic garden, the  University of Alberta Botanic Garden and Field Laboratory was established in 1959, when Mr. and  Mrs. H.A. Dyde donated 80 acres of land near Devon, Alberta for the purpose.  The Garden  maintained close ties for many years with the Department of Botany, the chair of the department  serving as part-time director.  An advisory committee supervised the Garden until 1976, when it  became an independent unit within Interdisciplinary Studies under its new name, the University of  Alberta Devonian Botanic Garden.  The name acknowledged major and ongoing financial assistance  from the Devonian Foundation.  At that time a full-time director was appointed and the advisory committee was reorganized to become the President's Standing Advisory Committee, headed by the  chair of the Department of Botany, who also serves as Associate Director of the Garden.  In 1981,  administrative responsibility for the Garden was transferred to the Office of the Vice-President  (Research) and in 1986 the Garden assumed control of the University of Alberta Microfungus  Collection.  A Friends of the Garden organization, which continues to support the program, was  formed in 1971.  The Devonian Botanic Garden is a tri-faceted garden with research, display, and  education functions.  It includes a nature conserve, two ecological reserves and the Kurimoto  Japanese Garden. Directors: 1959-1970 James Howden Whyte; 1970 Wilson N. Stewart; 1971-1976 Paul R. Gorham;  1976-1991 Patrick D. Seymour.</p>
