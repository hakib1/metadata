        <p>In the year 2005 Alberta will celebrate one hundred years as a Canadian Province.  In order to determine the potential for a centennial history project, scholars from across Canada met at Red Deer College from May 12th to 14th, 1988.  The Steering Committee for this workshop consisted of Professors David Hall, Rod Macleod, and John Foster of the University of Alberta, Professors Howard Palmer and David Jones of the University of Calgary, Professor Bill Baker of the University of Lethbridge, and John Tobias, Dean of Arts and Education at Red Deer College.  Funding for the workshop came from the Alberta Historical Resources Foundation, Red Deer College, and the Universities of Alberta, Calgary, and Lethbridge.  This is the first document in the planning process for a comprehensive centennial project.  (Summary report of the Project 2005 Workshop, edited by David R. Elliott, Red Deer College, 1988).  Copies of the report have been deposited in the Provincial Archives of Alberta, the Glenbow-Alberta Institute, and the Archives of the Universities of Lethbridge, Calgary and Alberta.</p>
