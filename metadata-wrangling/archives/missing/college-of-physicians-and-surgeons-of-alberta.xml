        <p>The College of Physicians and Surgeons was established in 1886 in what was then called the Northwest Territories.  When Alberta and Saskatchewan gained provincial status in 1905 they each formed their own division.  The College of Physicians and Surgeons of Alberta (CPSA) became incorporated under the Medical Profession Act of Alberta.  Under the Act and its amendments, the College is empowered and bound to protect the health of the public by licensing and disciplining doctors and conducting a formal inquiry into any complaint against a registered physician.</p>
