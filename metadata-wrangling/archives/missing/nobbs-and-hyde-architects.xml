        <p>Percy E. Nobbs' and Frank Darling's Montreal architectural firm was called to Edmonton by the Board of Governors of the University in 1910, to design the campus and buildings for the young institution.  Although their 1912 master proposal was not fully adopted, between 1914 and 1921 several buildings designed by Percy Nobbs and George T. Hyde were erected, exhibiting what they termed a "classical elastic" architectural style.  These included the Arts Building, the Medical Sciences Building, the North Power Plant, and the North and South Laboratories, all of which, excepting the North Lab, remain standing today.</p>
