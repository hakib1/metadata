        <p>Singer, 1869-1970.  During her career, vocalist M.A. Olenina-d'Alheim helped foster the music  of the Russian Mighty Handful movement, particularly that of Mussorgsky.  She founded the society  La Maison du Lied in 1908 and published a newspaper of the same name from 1910 to 1911 to  promote Russian vocal chamber music.  She is credited with introducing Mussorgsky and others to French and Belgian audiences.  She lived in France for nearly half her life before returning to her  native Soviet Union in 1959, where she continued to give master classes in vocal music.  A  frequenter of artistic circles that included Tolstoi and Debussy, Madame Olenina-dÃ¾Alheim was a  major performer of the Russian lied and one of the first Russian vocalists to promote the use of  poetic texts as sources for vocal music.</p>
