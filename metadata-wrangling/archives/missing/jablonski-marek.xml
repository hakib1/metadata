        <p>Pianist, Educator, 1939-1999.  Marek Jablonski was born in Nazi-occupied Crakow on November 5, 1939 and began studying piano as a youngster in the city's music conservatory. When Mr. Jablonski was ten, his family decided to leave Poland. They emigrated to Canada and settled in Edmonton. He continued his studies with Gladys Egbert and attended the Banff Centre for the Arts during the summer. In 1958, Mr. Jablonski won the Dimitri Mitropoulos scholarship and began advanced studies at New York's Juilliard School with Rosina Lhevinne, a well-known piano teacher and the wife of renowned pianist Joseph Lhevinne. In 1961, he won first prize in Canada's national Jeunesses Musicales competition and made his d√©buts with a number of Canadian, American, and European orchestras. He gave solo recitals in Paris (Salle Gaveau), London (Wigmore Hall), New York (Carnegie Hall), Vienna (Grossemusikvereinsaal), Milan, and Montreal (Place des Arts). Mr. Jablonski was one of the few soloists able to fill the large concert halls of Canada. Mr. Jablonski's repertoire included Liszt, Brahms, Beethoven, Mozart, Schubert, Szymanowski, and Rachmaninoff, but Chopin was his favourite. In 1971, the National Film Board of Canada produced Jablonski, a film about the pianist. In Toronto he shared the limelight with Glenn Gould in a concert featuring music of the 1920s. He was to continue concertizing for the rest of his life. Side by side with his concert career, Jablonski dedicated himself passionately to teaching. In addition to his regular students in Edmonton at the University of Alberta, he found the time and enthusiasm to give masterclasses in Toronto (the Royal Conservatory of Music), Montreal, Bergamo, Milan, and Corfu. The most popular of his masterclasses were those given each summer, from 1975 until his death, at the Banff Centre for the Arts. Mr. Jablonski's students include Jon Kimura Parker, Kevin Fitzgerald, Bernadene Blaha, and Francine Kay. In 1999 a Chopin prize for talented young pianists was established in his name and an endowment fund set up. Mr. Jablonski died in May 1999.</p>
