        <p>Steamboat engineer, tugboat Captain, 1897-1980.  Julian Mills was a tugboat captain who, for 30  years, pioneered transportation on Albertaþs northern waterways.  Born in Fort Simpson, N.W.T.,  he received his first shipboard experience under his father, long-time captain for the Hudsonþs Bay  Company. After World War I, he worked for the Company, first as an engineer, then as a captain,  before joining the Northern Transportation Company in Fort McMurray. His uncle was the  geologist, pioneer, and explorer, Charles Camsell.</p>
