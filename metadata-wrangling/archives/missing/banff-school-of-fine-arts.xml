        <p>The Banff School of Fine Arts was established by the Department  of Extension in 1933, under a grant from the Carnegie Foundation,  to provide training in theatre arts.  It expanded its mandate to  include fine, applied and performing arts: painting, music,  ballet, modern languages, writing, handicrafts, photography and  figure skating as well as theatre.  Courses were taken for  University credit, Banff School certificates, or for recreation and pleasure.  The School operated every summer until 1954, when,  under the title Banff School of Fine Arts and Centre for  Continuing Education, it began to offer year-round facilities for  all types of courses, seminars, workshops, conferences and  meetings.  For its services to adult education, in 1951 the School  received the Henry Marshall Tory Award from the Canadian  Association for Adult Education.  Under the Universities Act of  1966, the School was placed under the administration of the  University of Calgary.  In 1970 all of the units at Banff were  combined into the independent Banff Centre, which received its own  legislative Act in 1978. Directors: 1933-1936 Edward Annand Corbett; 1936-1968 Donald Roy  Cameron; 1968-1970 Donald F. Becker (Acting); 1970-1982 David  Leighton; 1982-  Paul Fleck .</p>
