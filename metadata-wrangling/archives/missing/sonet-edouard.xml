        <p>French scholar, Administrator, 1880-1971.  Edouard Sonet first taught at the University in 1911 as an instructor in French. After his leave to return to France for military duty, 1914-1919, he returned to the campus in 1920, becoming full professor in 1936.  From that year until 1947 he served as head of the Department of Modern Languages.  He left the University to lecture at the University of California at Berkeley (1947-1948) and Royal Roads, Esquimault (1948-1953).  The University of Alberta named him Professor Emeritus in 1951 and honorary LLD in 1960.  Dr. Sonet was known for his strict teaching methods; his book Voltaire et l'influence anglaise (1936) was considered the authority on the subject for many years.</p>
