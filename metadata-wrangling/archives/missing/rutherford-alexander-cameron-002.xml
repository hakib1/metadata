        <p>Lawyer, Politician, Chancellor, 1857-1941.  Alexander Cameron Rutherford came west to the Northwest Territories (now Alberta and Saskatchewan) to practise law.  He was Deputy Speaker of the N.W.T. Assembly from 1902 to 1905; from 1905 to 1910 he served as the first premier of the new province of Alberta.  It was he who in 1906 introduced the bill for the establishment of the University of Alberta.  He was elected Chancellor of the University in 1927, an office he held until his death.  The Rutherford Library is named for him, in recognition of his services to the University and his gift of books which established the first Library.</p>
