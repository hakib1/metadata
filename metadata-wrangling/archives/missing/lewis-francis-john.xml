        <p>Botanist, Administrator, 1875-1955.  Francis John Lewis came to the University of Alberta from the University of Liverpool in 1912 to become the first head of the Department of Botany.  In addition to his role in shaping the new department he served on the Senate from 1918 to 1920.  One of his major research projects was the study of the vegetation of central Alberta. In 1937 he left Edmonton to become chair of the Botany Department at Fouad I University in Cairo, where he taught until his retirement to England in 1946. There he continued his teaching, research and writing until his death.</p>
