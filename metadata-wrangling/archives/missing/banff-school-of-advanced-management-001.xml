        <p>The Banff School of Advanced Management was established in 1952  by the University of Alberta and from 1953 has been sponsored as  a cooperative undertaking by the Universities of Alberta, British  Columbia, Manitoba and Saskatchewan. By pooling the teaching  resources of the four Universities and supplementing these with a  selection of instructors from other universities, government and  private businesses in Canada and the United States, the Banff School of Advanced Management has been able to offer a course  which has met with an enthusiastic response from business  institutions in North America and abroad. Directors: 1952-1969 Donald Roy Cameron; 1969-1973 Allan H.  Anderson; 1973-1974 Victor Henning; 1974-[1977?] Jim Moran;  [1978?]-1981 Edwin M. "Ted" Mills.   Vice-President, Banff  Centre: 1981-[19Ã¾] Gary Frey.</p>
