        <p>Engineer, Administrator, Consultant, 1906-1985.  Robert M. Hardy joined the Department of Civil Engineering at the University in 1930.  In 1946 he was named head of the Department and Dean of the Faculty of Applied Science (renamed the Faculty of Engineering in 1948).  He retired from the University in 1959 to devote himself to his consulting company, R.M. Hardy and Associates, but he returned as Dean of Engineering from 1963 to 1971.  He was one of the first specialists in soil mechanics and foundation engineering, an expertise for which he gained international recognition.  Among many other honours, he received an honorary Doctor of Laws from the University in 1977 and was appointed an officer of the Order of Canada in 1974.</p>
