After holding positions with the National Research Council and the  Universities of Florida and Washington State, he returned to the University of Alberta in 1948 as associate professor of genetics and plant breeding.  He became professor the next year and chair of  the Department of Genetics from 1969 until his retirement in 1970.  A researcher in forest trees and  field crops, his work led to the licensing of two new strains of barley.  Besides his publications on  agronomy, he wrote short stories, novels and a biography of William Aberhart in collaboration with  Ola (Aberhart) MacNutt.</p>
