        <p>Zoologist, Ornithologist, 1891-1957.  Swiss-born ornithologist and naturalist William Rowan immigrated to Canada in 1919; in 1920 he became the first professor of the Department of Zoology, which he headed until his retirement in 1956.  He pioneered research into avian migration patterns and studied the cyclical population fluctuations of birds and mammals through banding studies.  Dr. Rowan was a strong proponent of wildlife conservation and active in fish and game associations. He was also an artist whose works were exhibited in Canada and England.  His drawing of a whooping crane was selected for the design of a Canadian postage stamp.</p>
