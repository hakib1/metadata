        <p>Named after Calgary physician John S. McEachern, the McEachern Cancer Research Laboratory  was initially funded by the Alberta division of the Canadian Cancer Society.  In 1959 it was  officially designated a cancer research centre, and after an extensive renovation that improved its biochemical facilities four years later, was renamed the University of Alberta Cancer Research Unit  (later Group).  Located in the Medical Sciences Building, it undertakes research supported by the  National Cancer Institute, the Medical Research Council, and the Alberta Heritage Foundation for  Medical Research.  Senior staff members hold joint appointments with the departments of  Biochemistry and Pharmacology. Directors: [1953-1962] R. Cameron Harrison ; 1962-1971 Alan Robb Phillips Paterson; 1972-  1980 Gerald Alan LePage; 1981-1983 Larry W. Brox (Acting); 1984-1990 Alan Robb Phillips  Paterson.   Coordinators: 1990-  Carol E. Cass.</p>
