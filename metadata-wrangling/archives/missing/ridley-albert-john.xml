        <p>Prospector, Businessman, 1879-1938.  Albert John Ridley left his parents' farm in Ridgetown, Ontario after high school to join the Klondike Gold Rush. Having journeyed west, he headed north from Vancouver in September 1899, to Skagway.  Following a year of travel and periods of sedentariness, he and his two companions reached Lousetown near Dawson City in July, 1900.  He remained in the Klondike until the fall of 1903.  After his return to Ontario, he took up various business ventures in Canada and the United States.  He finally settled in Birmingham, Alabama in 1908.</p>
