        <p>Chemist, 1897-1991.  A University of Alberta alumnus, Reuben "Bob" Sandin was hired by his alma mater in 1922 as a lecturer in Chemistry.  He gained his full professorship in 1943 and retired as Professor Emeritus in 1965.  As a biochemist he contributed to the synthesis of chemical agents for cancer treatment, but it was as a teacher that he gained the most recognition, receiving chemical education awards from the Chemical Institute of Canada and the Manufacturing Chemists Association.</p>
