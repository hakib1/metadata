        <p>Historian, 1938-1996. John Elgin Foster was born in Ontario but received most of his schooling in Calgary. He spent a short time at Royal Roads Military College in Victoria and then came to the University of Alberta graduating with a degree in history in 1959. While teaching high school, Foster worked on a master's degree and then decided to do a PhD under the supervision of Lewis G. Thomas. Foster joined the Department of History of the University of Alberta in 1970. He was one of a group of scholars who revolutionized the approach to the early history of western Canada, publishing about 30 articles during his career. Foster was one of the key organizers in the publication of the &lt;i&gt;Collected Writings of Louis Riel&lt;/i&gt; and coordinated the contributions and publication of &lt;i&gt;The Developing West: Essays in Canadian History in Honor of Lewis H. Thomas&lt;/i&gt;. Dr. Foster passed away in 1996.</p>
