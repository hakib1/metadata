        <p>AACES began as the Alberta Advisory Committee on Educational Research in 1954 but became  the Alberta Advisory Committee for Educational Studies in 1966.  Its original membership consisted  of the University's Faculty of Education, the Alberta Department of Education, the Alberta  Teacher's Association, the Alberta School Trustees Association (ASTA) and the Alberta Federation  of Home and School Associations (HSA).  ASTA and HSA dropped out of the Advisory Committee  during the 1980s, while the Universities of Calgary (1966) and Lethbridge (1987) have since joined.  The aim of AACES is to finance research in educational studies. To assist in the dissemination of research results it publishes the Alberta Journal of Educational Research and the Journal of  Educational Thought.</p>
