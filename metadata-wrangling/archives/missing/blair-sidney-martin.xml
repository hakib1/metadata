        <p>Engineer, 1897-1981.  Sidney Martin Blair was a professional engineer and former President and  Director of Canadian Bechtel.  After receiving an MSc from the University in 1924, he worked for  the Alberta Oil Sands Project which aimed at identifying methods that would separate oil from the  sand deposits.  In 1928 he became a manager of the asphalt refinery of Trinidad Leaseholds  Limited.  He joined Canadian Bechtel in 1949, retiring as its President in 1974, although he  continued to act as an advisor on special projects for the company.  He was killed in an accident in  1981.</p>
