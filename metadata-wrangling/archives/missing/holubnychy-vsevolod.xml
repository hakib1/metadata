        <p>Economist, 1928-1977.  Born in eastern Ukraine, Vsevolod Holubnychy fled with his family to  Bavaria in 1943 to escape the Red Army.  In 1951 he moved to New York City where he attended  Columbia University.  He was a professor at the City University of New York from 1962 until his  death.  A specialist in Soviet-type economies, he was active in Ukrainian nationalist organizations and at the time of his death was making arrangements with the Canadian Institute of Ukrainian  Studies at the University to work on an English-language Ukrainian Encyclopedia.  The Institute  published a small selection of his papers as Soviet Regional Economies: Selected Works of Vsevolod  Holubnychy, in 1982.</p>
