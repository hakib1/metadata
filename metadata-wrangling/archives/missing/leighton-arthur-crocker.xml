        <p>Painter, 1901-1965.  Between 1925 and 1929, A.C. Leighton was engaged by the Canadian Pacific Railway Company as its chief commercial artist.  He painted scenic views of Canada, produced models and paintings of trains and steamships, and designed promotional brochures.  With his term over, he settled in Calgary, and from 1929 to 1935 acted as Director of the Art Program at the Provincial Institute of Technology and Art.  He was co-founder of the Alberta Society of Artists and established a summer art school which eventually became incorporated into the Banff School of Fine Arts.</p>
