        <p>Known as the Institute of Law Research and Reform until 1990, the Alberta Law Reform Institute  was established by an agreement between the provincial government, the Law Society of Alberta  and the University of Alberta.  Its principal objective is to promote law reform, particularly on the  provincial level, and to conduct research in conjunction with its reform activities. Many of the  Institute's reports have been or are in the process of being enacted for legislation.  Staff periodically  publish papers prompted directly or indirectly by law reform projects. Directors: 1968-1975 Wilbur Fee Bowker; 1975-1986 William H. Hurlburt; 1986-1988 R. Grant  Hammond; 1988-  Peter J.M. Lown.</p>
