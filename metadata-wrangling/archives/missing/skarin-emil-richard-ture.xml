        <p>Civil engineer, 1882-1970.  After emigrating from Sweden in 1902, working at any available construction jobs, and starting his own construction company in partnership, Emil Skarin completed his university education by attending classes in his free time.  He graduated in 1918 with a BSc in civil engineering.  Mr. Skarin also served as the Swedish Vice-Consul (1920-1945) and Consul (1945-1950).  Mrs. Ada Fryk Skarin, who completed her BA degree in 1919 by attending classes amid her duties as housewife, mother and hostess, made a major gift to the University in memory of her husband.  The Skarin Fund is administered by the Senate and supports innovative community projects.</p>
