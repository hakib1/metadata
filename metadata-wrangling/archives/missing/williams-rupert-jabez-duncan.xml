        <p>Educator, [1893]-1973.  Rupert Williams, deaf since the age of five, graduated from the Manitoba School for the Deaf in Winnipeg and established a successful career in the printing trade.  He moved to Saskatchewan in 1927 to work as a printer and to campaign for a provincial school for the deaf similar to the one in Manitoba.  When the school was finally established in Saskatoon he was offered a position which he thought would be temporary.  He stayed for 30 years as chief supervisor of resident students.  He served frequently on the executive of the Western Canada Association of the Deaf, as well as on the board of its journal.</p>
