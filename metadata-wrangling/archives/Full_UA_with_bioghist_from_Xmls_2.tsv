Corporate body	Alberta Fitness Leadership Certification Association	1984 -		Alberta Fitness Leadership Certification Association	The Alberta Fitness Leadership Certification Association (AFLCA) facilitates the training and certification of fitness leaders and trainers in Alberta. Established in 1984, the association was founded by representatives of fitness agencies who were concerned with the consistency of fitness leadership in Alberta.

These agencies, in turn, represent their fitness leaders. The AFLCA adopted the guidelines put forth in 1984 by the National Fitness Leadership Advisory Committee (NFLAC). Performance standards were subsequently developed to recommend minimum competencies desired in the trained fitness leader. In 1989, the results of the comprehensive survey of leaders, trainers and agencies led the AFLCA towards the development of a new program model, which included more specialized areas of fitness training and more variety in courses for leaders to explore and agencies to administer. The mandate of AFLCA is to establish and implement specific standards and guidelines that organizations can follow for the training of their fitness leaders, to certify those leaders who have been trained and through that training have met the standards and guidelines established by the Association and to coordinate the standards and guidelines established by the National Fitness Leadership Advisory Committee (NFLAC) and to adjust these standards and guidelines to be most suitable for the fitness leaders of Alberta.	alberta-fitness-leadership-certification-association.xml

While it may be possible to distinguish between the activities of the Association and the Office, and between some of the papers of each, because the two are so intertwined and because the Office provides all of the administrative support necessary for the functioning of the Association, the Archives has combined the records in this description.

Person	Archer, Violet	4.24.1913 - 2.12.2000		Archer Violet	Violet Archer, distinguished composer and teacher, was born Violet Balestreri (Archer is the English translation of the Italian name) in Montreal on April 24, 1913. She studied piano and organ and received a B.Mus. in composition from McGill University in 1936, and studied organ with John Weatherseed at the Royal Canadian College of Organists. Throughout her years in Montreal, Archer was an active soloist, accompanist, and private music teacher as well as a percussionist with the Montreal Women's Symphony under the direction of Ethel Stark. She obtained her B..Mus. and M.Mus degrees in composition from Yale (1948 and '49). Amongst her teachers were Bela Bartok and Paul Hindemith. She was composer-in-residence at North Texas State College (1950-1953), and taught at Cornell University (1952) and the University of Oklahoma (1953-1961) before coming to the University of Alberta (1962-1978).

Corporate body	Assiniboia Community Housing Cooperative		The Assiniboia Community Housing Cooperative (ACHC) began its existence known as Campus Co-operative Association in March of 1967. Its initiative at that time was to provide low-cost housing to students at the University of Alberta, in a time before HUB, Lister Hall, or Michener Park were completed.     In September of 1967, the University’s Board of Governors, whose task it was to oversee University-owned properties, rented six houses to the fledgling organization in the North Garneau area. By the early 1970’s, the Co-op reached its membership peak of about 65 members, and purchased their first house in the Strathcona area. A second home was purchased in 1973 in Parkallen. Using a ‘capital loan’ system where members ‘loaned’ the Co-op $25 each upon taking out membership, monies were collected for initial down payments on homes. A ‘capital levy’ plan was later introduced whereby the Co-op charged a capital levy per member, on top of the monthly housing charge, as a means of raising capital for the expansion of the Co-op and for meeting maintenance costs on existing properties. In the early 1970’s, as well, the Co-op obtained a further four rented houses from the City of Edmonton. Original University-owned houses were occasionally demolished in the North Garneau neighbourhood, and the Co-op received other houses in replacement. A few other houses were rented from private landlords and by the summer of 1973, there were twelve houses in the Campus Co-operative Association.     In 1977 the Campus Co-operative Association was dissolved by the Co-op Development Branch of the Alberta Department of Consumer and Corporate body Affairs for failing to submit an audit form on time. A new set of by-laws and a policy manual were developed and the Co-op was reinCorporate bodyd on September 27, 1978 as the Campus Co-operative Association (1977). By 1981, the new name of Assiniboia Community Housing Cooperative was chosen to reflect a shift away from a majority student membership which prevailed at its inception in 1967.     Membership in the houses was open to anyone accepted by the members of a Co-op household, and subsequently approved by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors consisted of four executive members elected at semi-annual general meetings, and of one house representative from each house; board meetings were held monthly, and were open to the general membership to attend. Various committees were established to deal with specific matters, and members were expected to work on a committee or do some other specified work for the Cooperative. Members also shared cooking and other house chores. Membership criteria evolved over time to accept both student and non-student membership, and houses were co-ed. In 1986, the AHCC owned five houses and ceased leasing property from the University.     While the records in the fonds go only to 1990, the Assiniboia Community Housing Cooperative continues to function. They are a listed entry in the University of Alberta’s Student Union Housing Registry (as of 2006), and advertise three houses available in the Cooperative.	Assiniboia Community Housing Cooperative	The central aim of the cooperative housing associations at the University is to provide low cost housing to students.  The Campus Co-operative Association was founded in 1967.  It was dissolved and amalgamated with Campus Co-operative Association (1977), which changed its name to Assiniboia Housing Community Cooperative in 1981.  In 1986 the AHCC owned five houses and ceased leasing property from the University.	assiniboia-community-housing-cooperative.xml

The family moved to Alberta when he was four years old, settling first at Pine Lake, southeast of Red Deer, and then on land at Dewberry in 1906. Later, he lived with an uncle in the Edmonton area while completing his schooling at Strathcona Collegiate Institute and attending classes in mining engineering at the University of Alberta.   From 1917 to 1919 he was a flying instructor with the Royal Air Force, at which time he became associated with Khaki University and subsequently the University of Birmingham, where he received his B.Sc. in Mining in 1922. On his return to Alberta he registered as a graduate student at the University of Alberta, centering his attention on the oil sands at Fort McMurray and working both in the laboratory and in the field under the guidance of Karl A. Clark. His thesis for his Master of Science degree, ""An Investigation of the Bitumen Constituent of the Bituminous Sands of Northern Alberta,"" was accepted in 1924, after which he was a research engineer with the Scientific and Industrial Research Council of Alberta.   In 1926 Blair joined the Universal Oil Products Company's laboratories in Chicago to take part in oil cracking research, and then started his work with a company known as Trinidad Leaseholds Limited as Development Manager of the asphalt refinery. Following his marriage in 1927 to Janet Russell Gentleman, and after the birth of his children Sidney Robert, and Mona Helen, family homes were established at various times in Trinidad, England, the United States and Canada. From the outbreak of World War II until 1947, he was involved with the construction of refineries capable of producing high octane aviation fuel for the British Air Ministry, a top secret war project carried out in Trinidad.   Returning to Canada in 1949, he bought a house near Bolton, Ontario, and at the same time, as an engineering consultant and Vice-President of Canadian Bechtel Limited, he began his long association with the Bechtel Corporation. In the ensuing years he was involved in the planning and construction of oil refineries and chemical factories, numerous pipeline systems. Although he officially retired as President of Canadian Bechtel Limited in January 1974, he continued to act in an advisory capacity to the Company on special assignments in Canada.   At the request of the Government of Alberta, he prepared the Report on the Alberta Bituminous Sands at the First Oil Sands Conference held in Edmonton in September 1951. The ""Blair Report"", as it came to be known, was based on his own early studies in oil sands and on scientific, technical and economic advice garnered from a number of other scientists noted for their expertise in their particular fields.   He was a member of the Professional Engineers of Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec, and the Petroleum Institute of Canada, as well as numerous American and British associations. He held directorships not only within the Bechtel Corporation, but also with the Canadian Nuclear Association, Newfoundland Oceans Research and Development Corporation, natural gas and insurance companies, and a mortgage and trust company. Throughout his career he was the recipient of many awards, the most outstanding being: the honorary degrees he received from Memorial University, Newfoundland, the University of Alberta, and the University of Waterloo; the Professional Engineers Gold Medal from the Association of Professional Engineers of the Province of Ontario; the Canadian Silver Jubilee certificate and medal for meritorious service.   His first wife, Janet (Nettie), died in January 1974, and in 1979 Dr. Blair married Dr. Margaret Milton, a Toronto coroner. They continued to live at Cedar Mains until he was struck by a car and killed on the night of February 13, 1981"	Blair Sidney Martin	Engineer, 1897-1981.  Sidney Martin Blair was a professional engineer and former President and  Director of Canadian Bechtel.  After receiving an MSc from the University in 1924, he worked for  the Alberta Oil Sands Project which aimed at identifying methods that would separate oil from the  sand deposits.  In 1928 he became a manager of the asphalt refinery of Trinidad Leaseholds  Limited.  He joined Canadian Bechtel in 1949, retiring as its President in 1974, although he  continued to act as an advisor on special projects for the company.  He was killed in an accident in  1981.	blair-sidney-martin.xml

As a member of the Toronto Globe he covered the House of Commons from 1872 to 1874. He moved from the Globe to become editor of the Ottawa Times in 1874. He began his Canadian civil servant career as editor and chief reporter for the House of Commons when reports began 1875.

Person	Burgess, Cecil Scott	1870 - 11.12.1971	Cecil Scott Burgess was born in Mumbai, India in 1870, where his father, James Burgess, was Director of the Archeological Survey. The Burgess family returned to Edinburgh, Scotland the following year. Between the years 1887 and 1891 Burgess studied at the Royal High School in Edinburgh. He graduated with a gold medal. Burgess then studied architecture as an articled pupil to Sir George Washington Browne. He completed a four-year apprenticeship, a contemporary British standard, from 1892 to 1896. After completing his apprenticeship Burgess was admitted as an Associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA). It was a typical career path for British architects to travel through offices and projects gaining a resume of design experience and Burgess was no exception; following his apprenticeship Burgess did architectural work in Edinburgh, York, London, and Liverpool. He also continued to refine his skills with European travel studying and sketching the notable buildings, designs and works of art across the continent. It was during one of his study trips in 1903 he encountered the Edinburgh architect Percy Nobbs in Italy. Nobbs was about to accept a position to teach at McGill University in the Faculty of Engineering. Upon viewing Burgess's sketchwork he encouraged him to move to Montréal where he would find opportunities as a draughtsman. Burgess recognized the opportunity and before the end of the year, he was working in his profession designing several Québec projects including the Boys Farm and Training Schoold at Shawbridge, Quebec and several Montréal homes. In Montréal Burgess began his lifelong public advocacy of the Arts and Crafts design movement through public lectures and study groups. He delivered talks at the Province of Quebec Association of Architects and spoke at such public forums as the St. James Literary Society and the Grand Trunk Literary Institute. Without a Phd, Burgess nevertheless delivered lectures and taught courses at McGill between 1909 and 1911. The courses Burgess instructed betray the Arts and Crafts school of architecture he subscribed to. The were weighted to art and history and included historical drawing, architectural history and decoration. Recognizing it unlikely he would become permanent faculty, Burgess's acquaintance with Percy Nobbs again resulted in employment. Nobbs recommended Burgess to H.M. Tory, the first president of the newly conceived University of Alberta. Through his architectural firm, Nobbs and Hyde, Nobbs worked as the principal consulting architectural firm for the University and Nobbs requiered a supervising representative on the campus to see through to completion the firm's designs. President Tory appointed Burgess Professor of Architecture in 1913. He was made responsible to superintend the design of university buildings and design courses for the university's Department of Architecture. Upon his arrival Burgess designed Pembina Hall and the original six staff residences now known as the Ring Houses. He was the supervising architect for the Arts building (1915), designed the south wing of the University Hospital, University Farm buildings and cottages and the Varsity Rink, the University ice arena (1927). As University Architect Burgess also designed versions of the University crest, furniture, and various items of ceremonial regalia for official University occaisions. In addition to campus designs, Burgess was the associate architect for the Edmonton Natural Resources Building (now the Bowker Building) for the Provincial Government, the Birks Building and numerous private houses, memorials, and small design items across Alberta.

Person	Cameron, Alan Emerson		Dr. Cameron became acquainted with the University of Alberta through assisting Dr. John A. Allan, head of the Department of Geology, in the Kicking Horse Pass area during the summer of 1912. While he was completing his M.Sc. in Mining Engineering at McGill University in 1914, he was invited to become a lecturer in engineering and geology at the University of Alberta. He came to Edmonton that fall, and remained with the University until 1937.     The First World War interrupted Dr. Cameron’s teaching career, but he returned to Edmonton in 1919 after instructing in the Khaki University, established by Henry Marshall Tory. During the summers he made geological explorations for private industry and the government in Northern Alberta and the Northwest Territories. His explorations and surveys for the Geological Survey of Canada and for mining and petroleum companies, many times with the assistance of students from the Department of Mining and Metallurgy, included the areas of Hay River, Beaver River, Great Slave and Great Bear Lakes and Lake Athabasca.     In 1920 Dr. Norman C. Pitcher was appointed Professor of Mining and head of the Department of Mining Engineering (now the Department of Mineral Engineering); A.E. Cameron thereafter concentrated on metallurgy. He completed his studies toward his Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology during this period, receiving his doctorate in 1926. He was active in research as well as in field surveys, and served as Secretary of the Research Council of Alberta for ten years until his departure from the province in 1937. Cameron was also an active member of the “Murderers’ Club.” To the regret of the University community, Dr. Cameron left Edmonton to become Deputy Minister of Mines for the province of Nova Scotia. In 1947 he became President of Nova Scotia Technical College, remaining in that post until his retirement in 1957. During this period Dr. Cameron guided the College to full university status.

In 1940, Mr. Campbell, using his own theory to predict the amount of lead and zinc hidden in the ground, persuaded Cominco to develop a seemingly worthless tract of land at Pine Point, NWT, and this resulted in the Pine Point Mine, one of the richest lead-zinc mines in the world. In 1943, he recognized and solved the West Bay fault problem, which led to the discovery of substantial new reserves of gold in the Con mine and spurred Yellowknife's development as a mining community. For his efforts on West Bay, which was also the topic of his dissertation, Mr. Campbell received the Barlow gold medal from the Canadian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy. In 1956, he provided the geological direction for the discovery of the Wedge copper mine in New Brunswick. In 1966, he was appointed chief geologist for Cominco. Mr. Campbell retired from Cominco in 1968 but continued his work as a geological engineer by forming his own consulting practice, which aided geological exploration in several different continents. In 1970, he received an honourary doctorate from the University of Alberta for his lifetime achievements. Mr. Campbell passed away in 1976. Mr. Campbell was survived by his wife Eunice, and his three children Alan, John, and Laura Ruth.	campbell-neil.xml

Corporate body	Catalyst Theatre			Catalyst Theatre	The Catalyst Theatre was incorporated in 1978, but began from Theatre for Social Action projects directed by David Barnet in the Drama Department of the University of Alberta. One such piece, entitled Drinks before Dinner (1977), caught the attention of the Alberta Alcoholism and Addiction Commission and the commission funded a provincial tour of the piece. Soon other social agencies began to make inquiries, and Catalyst Theatre was formed, with Barnet the acting part-time artistic coordinator. In 1979, Jan Selman, a M.F.A. grad from Alberta, was hired to be Catalyst's first full- time artistic director. Catalyst's stated objectives from the outset were to "promote and practice the use of theatre for public education and as a catalyst for social action." Topics explored under this mandate included alcoholism and drug abuse, juvenile crime, spouse abuse, poverty and teen suicide. Plays were performed in whatever space the sponsors or tour location had available.  In 1985, Ruth Smillie replaced Jan Selman as artistic director. During Smillie's tenure Catalyst moved away from producing pieces for social agencies and began to pursue projects of its own choosing. In 1990, Catalyst, for the first time acquired its own performance space in the Edmonton neighbourhood of Garneau. The new performance space, though small, became known for its experiments in cabaret theatre. During Smillie's tenure, the theatre also developed the Takwakin project featuring the writing and direction of Floyd Favel. Favel's works All my Relations (1990) and Lady of Silences and Requiem (1992) featured all-Native casts and sought to develop new images of and for the contemporary native. Smillie resigned in early 1996 and was succeeded by the directing tandem of Joey Tremblay and Jonathan Cristenson. To cut costs, they moved Catalyst into a converted warehouse at 8523- 103 St., and revised the objective of Catalyst to focus on theatrical innovation instead of social change. The new commitment was to "creating original Canadian work that explores new possibilities for the theatrical art form and the process through which it was created," to "exposing work nationally and internationally", and to "challenging the artists and audiences who participate in the creation of that work."	catalyst-theatre.xml

Corporate body	Chancellor and Senate	1906 -	The Alberta University Act, 1906, created the Senate as the governing body of the University of Alberta. Its first meeting, in March 1908, set the policy for the opening of the University in September of that year. The original mandate of the Senate addressed all academic activities of the University, and was originally responsible for interpreting the University to the public, administering faculty councils, and addressing the activities of all academic staff. In 1910 the Act was rewritten, giving administrative powers to the Board of Governors and academic powers to the Senate. A further revision in 1942 assigned academic authority to the General Faculties Council and brought the Senate’s duties and powers closer to what they are today under the provisions of the Universities Act of 1976: “It is the duty of the senate to inquire into any matter that might tend to enhance the usefulness of the university.” The responsibilities of the current Senate involve communication and public outreach; it seeks to stimulate discussion on issues of concern and to aid in their resolution, and acts as a bridge between the University and the public. (From the Past to the Future, pp 7)    The Senate, chaired by the Chancellor of the University, comprises 62 members which include: 30 elected members of the public representing affiliated colleges or institutions, geographical areas and groups, and organizations with an interest in the University; 9 members of the public appointed by the Minister of Advanced Education; 2 members of the non-academic staff, appointed by the Minister of Advance Education; 2 appointees from the Board of Governors; 3 appointees from the General Faculties Council; 2 appointees from the Deans’ Council; 2 appointees from the Alumni Association; 4 students appointed by the Students’ Union; 1 student appointed by the Graduate Students’ Association; and 7 ex officio members (including the presidents of the University and the Alumni Association).    Formal meetings of the Senate are half-day long and are usually held four times a year, under the chairmanship of the Chancellor. The Chancellor, who confers all degrees, is the titular head of the University and represents the public interest in the University. These meetings, open to the public, are used to “provide Albertans with information on matters of interest or current concern in post-secondary education” (Senate brochure).    It is the mandate of the Senate to communicate the needs and views of Albertans to the University and the Alberta government, and to interpret to the public the many facets of the University. The Senate has the power to require a report from any part of the University, and may receive submissions from any member of the public. Ad hoc committees may be set up to consider specific issues, or a task force may be formed to investigate an educational matter brought to Senate’s attention. Subsequently, the Senate will present a report with recommendations, and establish follow-up committees to consider how the recommendations are being implemented.    The current Senate has five standing committees: Executive; Nominating; Honorary Degrees; Community Relations; and one to allocate the Emil Skarin Fund. The work of the Senate is coordinated by and executive officer and support staff.    The Senate has the power to confer honorary degrees, and in this way is able to recognize in a distinctive way the contributions that Albertans and others have made to life and learning. The Senate is also involved in seeking financial support for projects closely associated with its role.	University of Alberta Chancellor and Senate	By the authority of the University Act of 1906 the Senate was the sole governing body of the University.  Its first meeting, in March 1908, set the policy for the opening of the University in September of that year.  In 1910 the Act was rewritten, giving administrative powers to the Board of Governors and academic powers to the Senate.

It is the mandate of the Senate to inquire into any matter that might tend to enhance the usefulness of the University.  It is specifically authorized to interpret the University to the public; to require reports from faculty councils, the Students' Council, and any members of the academic staff; to receive and consider submissions from anyone interested in the University; to arrange for public meetings, radio and television programs and other means of providing and acquiring information on the University; as a consequence, to make reports and recommendations to the Board or the General Faculties Council or other appropriate body.  In addition, the Senate authorizes the conferring of Honorary Degrees. The Senate brings together the University and the public. Although it has little formal decision-making power, it seeks to stimulate discussion on issues of concern and to aid in their resolution.  It is a two-way link between the communities (Calendar 1990/91).

Corporate body	Chinook Theatre			Chinook Theatre	Chinook Theatre/Fringe Theatre Adventures began in 1978 as Chinook Touring Theatre, a theatre for young audiences. Founded in Fort St. John, British Columbia by Brian Paisley and Ti Hallas, its mission was to "open an archway to accessible theatre adventures by and for the community." Paisley and Hallas moved the company to Edmonton in 1980, scheduling tours all over Alberta from its offices in the basement of the Princess Theatre on Whyte Avenue., before moving into a renovated firehall on 83rd Ave. in 1983. This site contained offices and a 175-seat theatre that was used for in-house productions and rented to other artists and theatre groups. The Chinook Theatre produced a number of original and adapted works but failed to develop a strong local audience or identity. In 1986, its name was changed to Chinook Theatre Society. While its attempts to develop a strong local presence with its own works were unsuccessful, the Fringe Festival certainly did. Using a $50 000 grant from Summerferst, Chinook created the Fringe Festival in 1982. Borrowing heavily upon the structure of the Edinburgh Fringe, Chinook set up theatre spaces and rented them out to performers. There was no pre-screening and quality was mixed, but the Fringe soon became an integral part of Edmonton's summer. The original Fringe had five venues, but quickly grew and peaked at 14 venues in 1993 and 1994. Total attendance figures passed the half-million by the early 1990s but many of the visitors were attracted more to the ambience of the Festival than the works themselves. In 1995, reflecting the popularity of the Fringe, Chinook changed its name once again, this time to Fringe Theatre Adventures Society.	chinook-theatre.xml

Corporate body	Department of Biological Sciences		The Department of Biological Sciences came into existence with the merger of five former departments (Botany, Entomology, Genetics, Microbiology and Zoology) on July 1, 1994. What occurred on July 1, 1994 was actually a 2-step merger. Discussions on the merger between the Department of Entomology in the Faculty of Agriculture, Forestry and Home Economics and the Department of Zoology in the Faculty of Science was already well on its way when the decision to merge all five departments was made. The Departments of Entomology and Zoology merged first into a “new Department of Zoology”, bringing Entomology into the Faculty of Science; this “new Department of Zoology” then merged instantaneously with Botany, Genetics, and Microbiology forming the Department of Biological Sciences.      Although the Department of Biological Sciences is relatively young, the history of its constituents can be traced back to the early years of the University of Alberta. A Department of Biology already existed by 1912 at the University of Alberta in the then Faculty of Arts and Science. In 1921, the Departments of Zoology and Botany were formed from this Department of Biology. So in some ways, history has come “full-circle” with the 1994 merger. The former Department of Entomology was formed in 1922 in the Faculty of Agriculture. The Department of Genetics was formed in October 1, 1961 in the Faculty of Agriculture, and moved into the Faculty of Science in 1966. The former Department of Microbiology started in1957 as a Division in the Department of Bacteriology, in the Faculty of Medicine and moved into the Faculty of Science in 1963 and becoming a department. Thus, the Department of Biological Sciences can trace some of its roots to three different faculties on campus.      The Department of Biological Sciences and its former entities have always been heavily involved in undergraduate teaching for students in science, medicine and agriculture. In addition to undergraduate teaching, graduate student training has also been a valued tradition. The Department of Biology graduated its first MSc student in 1916 (Gwendelyne Tuttle; supervisor: F. Lewis). By the end of 1994, the five former departments have graduated a total of 1168 graduate students. This tradition continues in the Department of Biological Sciences with 261 MSc and 168 PhD theses successfully completed from January 1, 1995 to February 28, 2004.      Since its formation in 1994, the Department of Biological Sciences has continued to build on the excellence inherited from the former departments.

Besides offering professional training in pharmacy at the undergraduate level it provides graduated programs leading to a Master of Pharmacy, Master of Science and Doctor of Science degress, as well as continuing education courses. Research conducted within the Faculty has included the fields of bionucleonics, medical chemistry and pharmacokinetics."	 
Corporate body	Department of Pharmacology	1960 -	In the 1950's it was customary in many North American Universities for Departments of Pharmacology and Physiology to be single departments. This was true of the University of Alberta until 1960, when it was decided that Pharmacology and Physiology should be separated.    The Department of Physiology was Chaired by Dr. Jim Pearce, and Dr. Edwin E. Daniel was recruited from the University of Manitoba to Chair the Department of Pharmacology in 1961. He remained Chair until Dr. John Charnock was appointed in 1972.    The early Department had few pharmacologists: Dr. Charles Nash had previously looked after the pharmacological interests of the combined department, and, of course, moved over to a full-time position in Pharmacology. Dr. Jack Taylor, a toxicologist with a well-developed research interest in anticholinesterases, was also associated with the previous combined Department. Dr. Tim Cameron, an anesthesiologist who was later to become Dean of Medicine at the University of Alberta, soon joined them. As well, Dr. Bill Mahon, a clinical pharmacologist joined the department in 1967. Dr. Gerry Marks joined the Department in 1963, bringing an emphasis on biochemical pharmacology. Drs. George Frank, Rod Reiffenstein and Don MacLeod, all of whom could be characterized as neuropharmacologists, followed him.     During Dr. Daniel's term as Chair, the Department grew to become one of the largest in Canada. On Dr. Daniel's resignation in 1972, the incoming Chair, Dr. John Charnock, had a Department of about 14 academic staff. From 1972-1980, the numbers remained approximately constant, but the advent of, amongst other things, the Alberta Heritage Foundation for Medical Research, permitted the Department to conduct further recruiting in the 1980's. Dr. David Cook was the third Chair of the Department, from 1980-1991. After brief interregnum in which Dr. William Dryden assumed the position of Acting Chair, Dr. Ian Martin, was recruited from Cambridge and became Chair in 1992. Dr. Martin stepped down in 1997. Dr. Alexander S. Clanachan was appointed Acting Chair in 1997, and in January, 1999, was appointed Chair.    Among its alumni, including both academic staff and those who have carried out graduate studies in the Department, are more than a dozen Deans, Department Chairs or Division Directors, five Presidents of the Pharmacological Society of Canada, two Presidents of the Western Pharmacology Society, and many others with successful careers in government, industry and academia.

Person	Deville, Edouard-Gaston Daniel	February 21, 1849 - 9.21.1924	Was the first to perfect a practical method of photogrammetry, the making of maps based on photography. He was the Surveyor General of Canada (1885–1924) and Canada's Director General for the Bureau of Surveys (1922–24). During his lifetime, Canadian surveyors had used his phototopography to map 83,678 square kilometres, roughly the size of the United Kingdom.    In 1875, Deville began working as a surveyor and astronomer in Quebec, Canada. He was quickly promoted to the position of the province's top surveyor, Inspector of Surveys. He passed exams in high-level survey theory, earning the rare designation of Dominion Topographic Surveyor. In 1880, he joined the survey for homesteads in the Prairie provinces with the Department of the Interior in Ottawa. For many years, Deville directed Canadian surveying activities. He used innovative techniques to deal with the challenges of surveying in Canada, including a special method of mapping mountainous regions that he invented.    In 1881, Deville was appointed inspector for Dominion Land Surveys. In 1885, he became Surveyor General of Canada.    In 1922, he represented Canada at a geophysics conference in Rome, and his expertise on mountain surveys became sought after internationally. A copy of his camera was used to map the north slope of Mount Everest. His technology was adopted by the Geological Survey of Canada and the International Boundary Commission.	 
Corporate body	Devonian Botanic Garden	1959 -	Following an unsuccessful attempt to organize a combined City -University botanic garden, the University of Alberta Botanic Garden and Field Laboratory was established in 1959, when Mr. and Mrs H. A. Dyde donated 80 acres of land near Devon, Alberta for the purpose. The Garden maintained close ties for many years with the Department of Botany, the chair of the department serving as part-time director. An advisory committee supervised the garden until 1976, when it became an independent unit within Interdisciplinary studies under its new name, the University of Alberta Devonian Garden. The name acknowledged major and ongoing financial assistance from the Devonian Foundation. At that time a full- time director was reorganized to become the President's Standing Advisory committee, headed by the chair of the Department of Botany, who also serves as Associate Director of the Garden.    In 1981, administrative responsibility for the Garden was transferred to the Office of the Vice- President (Research) and in 1986 the Garden assumed control of the University of Alberta Microfungus collection. A Friends of the Garden organization was formed in 1971. The Devonian Botanic Garden is a tri-faceted garden with research, display, and education functions. It includes a nature conserve, two ecological reserves and the Kurimoto Japanese Garden.

Corporate body	Faculty Saint-Jean	1970 -	College Saint- Jean was founded in 1908, the same year as the inauguration of the Faculty of Arts and Science of the University of Alberta. The College became Collage Universitaire Saint- Jean, an integral part and bilingual sector of the University of Alberta, 62 years later on November 27, 1970, and the name changed to Faculty Saint- Jean in May 1978.    The first goal of the Faculte is to allow students of French background to pursue their university studies in a French environment and secondly, to allow students of English background to benefit by this environment. The University thus hopes to foster French culture in Alberta and to allow more students to master the two official languages of Canada.

Corporate body	Fringe Theatre Adventures	1978 -	"Fringe Theatre Adventures began in 1978 as Chinook Touring Theatre, a theatre for young audiences (TYA). Founded in Fort St. John, British Columbia, by Brian Paisley and Ti Hallas, its mission was to ""open an archway to accessible theatre adventures by and for the community.""   Paisley and Hallas moved the company to Edmonton in 1980, scheduling tours all over Alberta from offices in the basement of the Princess Theatre on Whyte Ave., before moving into the renovated Fire Hall No. 6 on 83 Ave in 1983. The 83 Ave. site contained offices and a 175-seat theatre for in-house productions and for rental to other artists, as well as for use by the Edmonton Fringe Theatre Festival which Chinook had initiated the previous summer.   The name changed to Chinook Theatre Society in 1986 and then again, to Fringe Theatre Adventures in 1995, marking the ascendency of the what had by then become the company's better known and more dynamic contribution to Edmonton local theatre. In 1995, the company also moved its operations into the old bus barns in Old Strathcona, renaming the complex the Strathcona Arts Barns, and embarking on a long-term plan to create a year-round theatre and cultural centre, complete with a permanent theatre to replace the temporary risers and facilities used for the Fringe.   The Arts Barns were leased from the City of Edmonton by Fringe Theatre Adventures for twenty years. The move was seen as necessary not only to create a larger theatre, but also to prevent commercial redevelopment plans for the bus barns, which were central to the continued healthy operations of the Fringe Festival.   Over the years Chinook's TYA program produced a combination of original works such as Paisley's Tikta'Liktak, James DeFelice's Merchants of Dazu and Ballad of the Bird Prince and Clem Martini's Swimmers and Gambetta Rise, and adaptations such as Tartuffe and The Odyssey, along with productions of playwrights such as Dennis Foon. The touring program was popular in smaller centres outside Edmonton, but attempts to secure a local audience and identity were less successful.   A ""Youth and Adult Audiences"" season was launched in 1985-86, with Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet and Sharon Pollock's The Komagata Maru Incident. However, a second such season for 1986-87 was cancelled because of tight budgets overall. At other times, Chinook would bring its touring show into its home theatre, but lack of a regular season or predictable schedule seemed to forestall audience loyalty, despite quality productions.   If the TYA program did not establish a strong local presence, the Fringe Festival did. The Fringe was established in 1982 on a $50,000 grant from SummerFest, to replace the cancelled Northern Light Theatre Shakespeare in the Park season. Paisley had been to the Edinburgh Fringe the year before, and recognized the potential of many of the empty buildings in the Old Strathcona district as potential theatre venues. The district was just at the start of a revitalization project, of which the Fringe Festival became a prominent component. Such a summer festival would also help secure year-round work for the Chinook staff.   The premise for the Fringe was simple enough. Chinook would set up theatre spaces, equipped with lights and sound, and with a technician. Artists would book performance space from Chinook, and perform whatever they wanted, taking whatever gate they could get from whatever audience they could attract. There would be no pre-selection or refereeing by an overseeing artistic director, just nine days of artists free to find their audiences.   The original Fringe had five venues, but as the Festival grew, it peaked at fourteen venues by 1993 and 1994, before ""shrinking"" to thirteen. Total attendance figures passed the half-million marks by the early '90s, though much of that was for the ambience and the street festival and outdoor shows that grew up alongside the indoor venues, rather than for the theatre offerings themselves.   The 1985 Fringe was particularly noteworthy in the evolution of the Festival, as that was the year it became possible to talk of ""Fringe hits,"" shows that could make a reasonable return for the artists, and attract enough audience to be restaged after the Festival itself was over. In that year, for example, Life After Hockey, by Ken Brown, went on to a national tour.   Although local performers have always been a feature of the Festival, performers also began to come from all over the country, and from the U.S. and abroad, raising audience expectations and the overall quality of stagecraft. However, there seemed to be a parallel diminishing of experimentation and innovation, as artists searched for the money-making production.   Eventually the Festival became a popular model and anchor for a string of similar events across the country, and spawned imitators in the U.S.   However, over time the anomalous, at times schizophrenic division of labour between the TYA and Fringe operations strained the administrative and operation energies of the company, especially when the Fringe became more than a few months of summer fill-in work for the staff. Ironically, perhaps, ""Chinook"" theatre was overshadowed by its ""marginal"" offspring, and the parent company was renamed for its more famous and demanding child.   Paisley remained as TYA Artistic Director until June 1987, and as Fringe Producer until 1989. He was succeeded as TYA Artistic Director in 1988 by Dorothy Ann Haug, who remained in that position for six years. Judy Lawrence, originally hired as Assistant Fringe producer in 1988, became Festival Director in 1990, and the overall Executive Director in 1995. David Cheoros became Festival Director in 1997. Lawrence resigned in January 1998, and was succeeded by Darryl Lindenbach.   When Chinook / Fringe Theatre Adventures took up permanent residence in the Arts Barns, it sublet the 83 Ave. space over to a consortium of eight independent companies, many with Fringe histories. The plan was to buy time for the consortium to prove itself, and to help establish the viability of two professional theatre venues in the district. The objective was to try to keep the 83 Ave. space active as a theatre, once a permanent theatre was developed in the Arts barns, and to prevent it from being redeveloped for some other enterprise.   After a shaky start, the consortium stabilized around Shadow Theatre and Teatro Quindicina, and the Die-Nasty improv soaps, producing out of what was renamed the ""New Varscona"" theatre. The future of the New Varscona remains in some doubt at the time of this writing, as the space is on a month-to-month lease and redevelopers from time to time make inquiries to the City about the property. To date, strong lobbying of City Council by theatre and business interests in the district, and by the Old Strathcona Foundation, has helped keep the site a theatre."

Such a summer festival would also help secure year-round work for the Chinook staff.   The premise for the Fringe was simple enough. Chinook would set up theatre spaces, equipped with lights and sound, and with a technician. Artists would book performance space from Chinook, and perform whatever they wanted, taking whatever gate they could get from whatever audience they could attract. There would be no pre-selection or refereeing by an overseeing artistic director, just nine days of artists free to find their audiences.   The original Fringe had five venues, but as the Festival grew, it peaked at fourteen venues by 1993 and 1994, before ""shrinking"" to thirteen. Total attendance figures passed the half-million marks by the early '90s, though much of that was for the ambience and the street festival and outdoor shows that grew up alongside the indoor venues, rather than for the theatre offerings themselves.   The 1985 Fringe was particularly noteworthy in the evolution of the Festival, as that was the year it became possible to talk of ""Fringe hits,"" shows that could make a reasonable return for the artists, and attract enough audience to be restaged after the Festival itself was over. In that year, for example, Life After Hockey, by Ken Brown, went on to a national tour.   Although local performers have always been a feature of the Festival, performers also began to come from all over the country, and from the U.S. and abroad, raising audience expectations and the overall quality of stagecraft. However, there seemed to be a parallel diminishing of experimentation and innovation, as artists searched for the money-making production.   Eventually the Festival became a popular model and anchor for a string of similar events across the country, and spawned imitators in the U.S.   However, over time the anomalous, at times schizophrenic division of labour between the TYA and Fringe operations strained the administrative and operation energies of the company, especially when the Fringe became more than a few months of summer fill-in work for the staff. Ironically, perhaps, ""Chinook"" theatre was overshadowed by its ""marginal"" offspring, and the parent company was renamed for its more famous and demanding child.   Paisley remained as TYA Artistic Director until June 1987, and as Fringe Producer until 1989. He was succeeded as TYA Artistic Director in 1988 by Dorothy Ann Haug, who remained in that position for six years. Judy Lawrence, originally hired as Assistant Fringe producer in 1988, became Festival Director in 1990, and the overall Executive Director in 1995. David Cheoros became Festival Director in 1997. Lawrence resigned in January 1998, and was succeeded by Darryl Lindenbach.   When Chinook / Fringe Theatre Adventures took up permanent residence in the Arts Barns, it sublet the 83 Ave. space over to a consortium of eight independent companies, many with Fringe histories. The plan was to buy time for the consortium to prove itself, and to help establish the viability of two professional theatre venues in the district. The objective was to try to keep the 83 Ave. space active as a theatre, once a permanent theatre was developed in the Arts barns, and to prevent it from being redeveloped for some other enterprise.   After a shaky start, the consortium stabilized around Shadow Theatre and Teatro Quindicina, and the Die-Nasty improv soaps, producing out of what was renamed the ""New Varscona"" theatre. The future of the New Varscona remains in some doubt at the time of this writing, as the space is on a month-to-month lease and redevelopers from time to time make inquiries to the City about the property. To date, strong lobbying of City Council by theatre and business interests in the district, and by the Old Strathcona Foundation, has helped keep the site a theatre."

A turning point came in his life when his grade ten teacher inspired him to pursue academics in university. Walter Harris achieved his educational goal receiving an Honours Bachelor of Science degree in 1938 and Master of Science degree in 1939 from the University of Alberta. Harris’ doctoral studies were completed at the University of Minnesota under the renowned analytical chemist I.M. Kolthoff. While researching his thesis on the polarography of uranium he was selected to work on the US Government Synthetic Rubber Program. This 1943 to 1946 project was a critical component of the war effort. Harris’ research component was to study the role of the mercaptans (thiols) in polymerization. For this work he developed an apparatus for amperometric titration that assisted in the analysis of small amounts of mercaptan. This apparatus measured the electrical currents produced by the point of a chemical reaction. Harris’ work in the program culminated in a paper, with I.M. Kolthoff on the use of amperometry for the determination of mercaptans in rubber formulations. During his Ph.D he met his future wife Phyllis, a graduate student in the public health field. She was very supportive of his career and even edited much of his writing. They were married on June 14, 1942 and had two children, Margaret and Bill. In 1946 Walter Harris joined the staff at the University of Alberta leading to a lifelong connection to the University. Harris’ first years focused on teaching, with heavy course loads and an overflow of post-war students. In the 1950’s additional professors were appointed to allow for more research opportunities across the department. In 1957, Harris went on sabbatical to complete research in hot atom studies with radio bromine. This work was completed with the Atomic Energy of Canada Limited at Chalk River Nuclear Laboratories. His research lead to a significant portion of his life's work on programmed temperature gas chromatography, which is the use of gas to separate compounds for analysis. This work culminated in the book “Programmed Temperature Gas Chromatography” written with Harry Habgood. When Harris returned to the University of Alberta, other North American Universities were closing or minimizing their analytical chemistry programs. Harris’ dedication to modernization made the program successful. He emphasized excellence in teaching and research practices, devoting time to perfecting experiments and lectures. Harris upheld conditions under which the highest standards could be achieved. Notably, his Chemistry 312 “Quantitative Analysis” course was influential to chemist graduates in the University of Alberta program, having taught them key research skills. Harris’ extraordinary efforts renewed the Analytical Chemistry program at the University of Alberta making it the best in Canada and among the best in North America. Harris published over one hundred articles in scholarly journals and wrote seven books independently or collaboratively with colleagues. Throughout his career, Dr Harris was involved in a variety of research interests including: uranium, synthetic rubber, amperometric titrations, hot atom chemistry, gas chromatography, chemistry education, academic reviews, and application of scientific methods to health risk assessments of radiation, as well as chemical and environmental contaminants. One of his greatest undertakings in chemistry education was the second edition of “Chemical Analysis”, a fundamental work for Analytical Chemistry. Written with H Laitinen, this book took thirty-six months to complete and greatly advanced the profile of the Analytical Chemistry Department at the University of Alberta. Another contribution to chemistry education was the publication with Ron Kratochvil, “Chemical Analysis, An Intensive Introduction to Modern Analysis,” which was a laboratory textbook that helped to modernize the teaching of analytical chemistry. Walter Harris’ served as the Chairman of the Department of Chemistry from 1974-1978. He focused on increasing faculty published research and tried to facilitate an open environment. Harris’ officially retired in 1980 but remained a continual presence at the University with the status of Professor Emeritus. After retirement in 1980 Harris’ remained busy serving on several committees. He was the Chairman of the President’s Advisory Committee on Academic review for fourteen years. This body examined academic and administrative units on campus to make recommendations for improvements. Harris worked for the Technical Advisory Committee from 1983 to 1997, which served as a consulting body on Nuclear Fuel Waste for the crown corporation Atomic Energy of Canada Limited. He was also part of the Alberta Environment Hazardous Waste Management Committee advising the implementation of a hazardous waste treatment facility located in Swan Hills. Much of his hazardous waste work involved the assessment of toxicity risks, culminating in a book entitled “Risk Assessment.” Harris received wide recognition for his accomplishments in both teaching and research. He was awarded the 1969 Fisher Scientific Lecture Award and the Chemical Education Award from the Chemical Institute of Canada. Harris was presented with the Outstanding Achievement Award from the University of Minnesota and the University of Alberta’s Alumni Honour Award. He received an Honorary Fellowship in the Chemical Institute of Canada and the American Chemical Society, of which he was a longstanding member. He was awarded honorary degrees in science from the University of Waterloo and the University of Alberta. He also received the Fellowship in the Royal Society of Canada as well as an Alberta Centennial Medal, and was appointed as a member of the Order of Canada. Outside of his professional work Harris enjoyed golf, curling, and the card game of bridge, along with travel and long walks. Harris and his wife were supporters of Planned Parenthood Edmonton, an organization influential in changing the Canadian Criminal Code to decriminalize contraception. Throughout his lifetime he kept in contact with colleagues, friends and family including his granddaughters Martha and Glenna. Walter Harris’ family described him as “one of a kind,” as well as, “simple, winning and direct.” Walter Harris passed away October 20, 2011. The WE Harris Teaching Workshop was established in 1976 and continues today as a legacy through an endowment in his honour. The annual workshop is held to facilitate discussion on teaching analytical chemistry, bringing together chemistry professors, lecturers, lab instructor and graduate students. Before passing away Harris set up the Walter and Phyllis Harris Graduate Scholarship in Analytical Chemistry. This was to assist graduate students and give back to the academic setting where he lived so much of his life. He will be remembered for his legacy in academic excellence, as well as his strong character and integrity.	harris-walter-edgar.xml

Marek Jablonski was born in Nazi-occupied Crakow on November 5, 1939 and began studying piano as a youngster in the city's music conservatory. When Mr. Jablonski was ten, his family decided to leave Poland. They emigrated to Canada and settled in Edmonton. He continued his studies with Gladys Egbert and attended the Banff Centre for the Arts during the summer. In 1958, Mr. Jablonski won the Dimitri Mitropoulos scholarship and began advanced studies at New York's Juilliard School with Rosina Lhevinne, a well-known piano teacher and the wife of renowned pianist Joseph Lhevinne. In 1961, he won first prize in Canada's national Jeunesses Musicales competition and made his débuts with a number of Canadian, American, and European orchestras. He gave solo recitals in Paris (Salle Gaveau), London (Wigmore Hall), New York (Carnegie Hall), Vienna (Grossemusikvereinsaal), Milan, and Montreal (Place des Arts). Mr. Jablonski was one of the few soloists able to fill the large concert halls of Canada. Mr. Jablonski's repertoire included Liszt, Brahms, Beethoven, Mozart, Schubert, Szymanowski, and Rachmaninoff, but Chopin was his favourite. In 1971, the National Film Board of Canada produced Jablonski, a film about the pianist. In Toronto he shared the limelight with Glenn Gould in a concert featuring music of the 1920s. He was to continue concertizing for the rest of his life. Side by side with his concert career, Jablonski dedicated himself passionately to teaching. In addition to his regular students in Edmonton at the University of Alberta, he found the time and enthusiasm to give masterclasses in Toronto (the Royal Conservatory of Music), Montreal, Bergamo, Milan, and Corfu. The most popular of his masterclasses were those given each summer, from 1975 until his death, at the Banff Centre for the Arts. Mr. Jablonski's students include Jon Kimura Parker, Kevin Fitzgerald, Bernadene Blaha, and Francine Kay. In 1999 a Chopin prize for talented young pianists was established in his name and an endowment fund set up. Mr. Jablonski died in May 1999.	jablonski-marek.xml

In addition to his Univesity lectures and clinics, Dr. Jamieson conducted a private practice in internal medicine where his specialized treatment of diabetic patients gained recognition not only for the excellent results obtained, but also because the methods used were far in advance of the times. In 1943 he was promoted to the rank of Professor of Clinical Medicine and although he retired from the University on October 5, 1946, his long association with the institution was continued in his being named Honorary Professor of that department. He retired from private practice in 1950 and died in Edmonton on February 20, 1962.     Heber Jamieson married Florence Lyon of the Ottawa Valley region before World War One and they had two daughters. During his career Dr. Jamieson wrote one book, Early Medicine in Alberta, The First Seventy-Five Years, and numerous articles that were originally prepared for presentation at medical meetings but were later published in provincial or national journals. Their theme is the development of medical facilities within the province, with special emphasis on doctors who were in the area before 1910, and on early hospitals and nursing care.

Initially, students accessed reference literature for medical studies through the University library located in the Arts building, completed in 1914. President Tory Mounted a campaign for a Faculty of Medicine following the First World War. By 1923 there was a full medical degree available and students and staff pursued research and studies in a newly completed medical building. The new building included a medical reading room. So anxious to limit strains on the library, Donald Cameron, University Librarian, opened a satellite reading room in the Medical Building in 1922 before the building’s construction was completed.

Person	Mills, Julian	1897 - 8.21.1980	"Julian ""Hooley"" Mills was a steamship captain who, for 45 years, pioneered transportation on Alberta's northern waterways. Julian Mills was born in 1897 in Fort Simpson, Northwest Territories. The Mills name is closely associated with northern river transportation; his father, James William Mills, was a captain of pioneer sternwheelers and builder of boats for the Hudson's Bay Transport. James Mills built the second steamship of the McMurray region, the McMurray.    In 1912 Julian Mills first worked on the northern waterways as a deckhand working for his father. After three years of service in World War I, Julian Mills returned to Northern Alberta. In 1921, he started working for the Hudson's Bay Company northern transportation operations. He worked for the Hudson's Bay Company for 20 years, first as an engineer on the Nechimus, then as a captain on the HBC tug Canadusa plying the Athabasca River between Fort McMurray and Lake Athabasca. He married Phyllis Burke in 1927. In 1940 he joined the transportation firm eventually known as the Northern Transportation Company in Fort McMurray.    When Eldorado Mining and Refining opened at Beaverlodge, Julian Mills worked aboard the tug Radium Prospector on the Lake Athabasca run to Bushell, the port used to supply the Mine. For twenty-two years Mills made the lake Athabsca crossing. Often he made as many as twenty-four crossings in a short and often stormy season.    Northern Alberta communities knew Julian Mills for more than servicing the northern economy with transporation of labour and material supplies. His ships were known as floating libraries loaded with reading material from books to magazines available to borrow. He also delivered and collected such literature from the local northern communities he serviced through their ports. Mills also provided his navigation skills to the RCMP, taking justice officials north to administer Canadian and provincial law and administration.    Mills retired in 1962 and moved to Edmonton in 1970. He continued his association with steamships in his retirement as a captain of the Klondike Queen, a deisel-powered paddle wheeler that offered cruises on the North Saskatchewan to Big Island, a recreation park near Edmonton. Mills died of heart failure in Edmonton on August 21, 1980. He was 82 years old."	Mills Julian	Steamboat engineer, tugboat Captain, 1897-1980.

Born in Fort Simpson, N.W.T.,  he received his first shipboard experience under his father, long-time captain for the Hudsonþs Bay  Company. After World War I, he worked for the Company, first as an engineer, then as a captain,  before joining the Northern Transportation Company in Fort McMurray.

Person	Minenko, Timothy	3.5.1929 - 5.30.2006	VERY REVEREND TYMOFIY MINENKO Priest, husband, father, grandfather, scholar, mentor. All describe the life of the Very Reverend Tymofiy Minenko who was called on Tuesday, May 30, 2006. Very Rev. Tymofiy Minenko was born March 5, 1929 in Brovarky, Poltava, Ukraine into the family of Semen and Paraskevia Minenko. In 1949, the family immigrated to the United States of America. In 1952, he married Anastasia Krywonos in New York City, and in 1955 was ordained to serve the Ukrainian Orthodox Church. He is survived by his wife Anastasia and four sons: Mark (Roma), Victor (Connie), Michael (Anne) and Paul (Barbara). He was also grandfather to Andrew, Sofia, Daniel, Sonia, Matthew and Nicholas. Also surviving him is his sister Anna and her children Catherine and Andrew. Fr. Tymofiy's religious studies began at the Theological Academy of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church in Munich, Germany and continued at St. Vladimir's Seminary in New York. He also studied at City University of New York and is an alumni of Brock University, ON. In 1984, he was awarded a Master of Divinity degree from St. Andrew's College in Winnipeg. Fr. Tymofiy's pastoral work included parishes in New York City, Toronto, Grimsby, Waterloo and Winnipeg. From 1975 to 1985 he served as editor of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada's newspaper - Visnyk. For his work, he was awarded his mitre in 1988 and was made a protopresbyter in 1999. He was involved in many church matters including being a member of the Church Court and Committees of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada. As a student and a young priest, Fr. Tymofiy became very involved in Ukrainian student and youth organizations in Germany, the United States and Canada. He passed on his love and knowledge of Ukraine through this involvement and by teaching at the parish schools at each of his parishes. Inspired by his teaching, many students became actively involved in the Ukrainian community. Fr. Tymofiy's love of teaching continued in Winnipeg when in 1978 he was appointed a professor of liturgics and church history at St. Andrew's College. In 1985 he was appointed Dean and served in this capacity until 1995. His involvement in the community included serving as a member of the Secretariat of the World Congress of Free Ukrainians, chairperson of Trident Press and as a member of the Ukrainian Free Academy of the U.S.A. and of the Order of St. Andrew. While Fr. Tymofiy authored many essays and articles over the years, the family was particularly proud when he recently published his first book on the Orthodox Church in Ukraine during the Second World War. At the time of his passing he had completed books on the Ukrainian Orthodox Church in the 20th Century and the Kievan Metropolia through the Ages. In his latter years, Fr. Tymofiy's greatest joy was his six grandchildren. Whether it involved listening to a grandchild's story, attending a piano or ballet recital, or flying at a moments notice to assist with the grandchildren in times of need, Fr. Tymofiy enjoyed his role as grandfather. He took great pride in every accomplishment of all his young grandchildren. The family would like to thank the doctors, nurses and staff of the Emergency and Surgical Intensive Care Units at the Health Sciences Centre for their expert and respectful care for Fr. Tymofiy. He will be missed and forever remembered by his wife Anastasia and family. Services will be held at 6:00 p.m. on Friday, June 2, 2006 at Holy Trinity Cathedral. Interment to be at South Bound Brook, New Jersey.

Corporate body	Mixed Chorus		The University of Alberta Mixed Chorus is among the oldest non-sport organizations on campus, tracing its beginning to 1939 when a small choir was formed under the direction of Ottoman Cypress to supply music for Student Christian Movement services. In 1943, the Varsity Choir applied for membership to the Literary Association of the Students Union, allowing the choir to apply for Student Union funding to purchase music for the expanding choir. Rehearsals and practices for the choir were organized for the fall of 1944, under the leadership of Gordon F. Clark, a first-year medical student. Their first concert was presented in Convocation Hall on campus in February 1945. Their repertoire of short classical pieces and traditional folk songs prompted a name change and in 1945, the organization became officially known as the University of Alberta Mixed Chorus.   The records have been arranged and described in two broad series and several sub-headings, with a basic chronological order maintained within each series. The textual files provide information about the early years of the Chorus' existence, particularly the years from 1946 to about 1971. Files maintained by the executive and directors (Richard Eaton and James Whittle) are significant for the information they provide about the Chorus' yearly operations and activities. Information in the files after the Whittle years is sketchier, and more incidental in nature. The textual files include correspondence, clippings, some meeting minutes, membership lists, the organization's constitution, and evidence of the planning and fundraising required to orchestrate the annual UAMC Spring Tour.   Under Professor Eaton's leadership, which was to last for twenty years, the Chorus increased in size and accomplishment.   The Mixed Chorus spring tour started in1947 to meet requests for the Chorus to appear in several Alberta cities and towns. The first tour, held between examination week and convocation in May, saw a group of about 80 members' travel through southern Alberta for nine days, giving a concert each night, and ending with a culminating performance in Convocation Hall in Edmonton. The Chorus dressed in formal attire for the tours; women in pastel evening gowns and men in dark suits and black bow ties. The spring tour (or May Tour) became an important annual event for the Mixed Chorus. Over the intervening years, tours expanded to include visits to communities in Saskatchewan, British Columbia, the Northwest Territories, Idaho, Washington, and Oregon.   Richard Eaton's sudden death while on sabbatical in 1968 was devastating to the Chorus members. James Whittle, a member of the Chorus and Assistant Conductor since 1964, took over as director of the after Professor Eaton's death. He conducted the Chorus in 1968, 1969 and 1971; Dr. David Stocker, a professor in the Department of Music, led the Chorus during 1970. In 1971, Dr. R.E. Stephens, Professor of Music Education at the University of Alberta, assumed the position of Conductor of UAMC, a post he held until 1986. His fifteen years with the Chorus were interrupted briefly by his sabbatical leave in 1979, when Merrill Flewelling conducted the Chorus. Robert de Frece, who sang in the Chorus from 1967 to 1971, took over as director of the UAMC from Ron Stephens in 1986 and is the present director.   In 1988, the Faculty of Education Handbell Ringers was established as a separate sub-group available to current members of the Mixed Chorus; the Handbell Ringers perform annually with the UAMC. The Mixed Chorus Alumni Association was established in 1991 to promote continuing contact among Mixed Chorus alumni and to support and promote the activities of the UAMC. An annual alumni dinner is held prior to the Mixed Chorus Spring Concert.

University of Alberta Museums and Collections Services	The University began receiving gifts of historical, artistic or scientific value as soon as it was  established.  Dr. John A. Allan, first professor of geology, planned a museum of teaching  specimens and began serious collecting upon his appointment in 1912.  In time, custody of the  collections in fine and applied arts, archaeological and anthropological specimens which were presented to the University, became part of his responsibility.  Each department had custody and  maintenance of any gifts it received.  Record keeping was erratic and storage conditions  substandard.  Dr. E.S. "Frank" Keeping, of the Department of Mathematics, initiated exhibitions of art works during the 1940s.  In most cases these were travelling exhibits.  From 1947 to 1949 Dr. Keeping  was officially Curator of Art Exhibits.  This post passed to H.G. Glyde, and his successors as  Chairs of the Department of Art, who served as Curator of the Art Gallery and Museum.  There  was still no central Art Gallery or Museum or registry on campus.  In 1964, the Fine Arts Gallery (not connected with University Collections until 1968) exhibited in  one of the houses acquired in the University's expansion into North Garneau.  The Gallery was  renamed "University Art Gallery and Museum" in 1968 and in 1970 moved to Ring House One, the  President's former home.  The Department of Art ceased funding for the Gallery and Museum in 1974.  Until the appointment  of Helen Collinson as Director and Curator in 1977, special funding kept the unit operating.  In 1977 the University Collections Centre was established.  The University took custody of all art  and museum materials made, received or collected by any department or officer of the University  for the purposes of teaching, research, reference or exhibition.  The Centre provided the services of  exhibit assistance, registration, preservation, and some storage. Policies on acquisitions, budget,  and liaison were reviewed by the University Collections Committee.  From 1986 to 1990 the University Archives and University Collections were amalgamated.  In 1990  the Archives was placed under the authority of the University Librarian; University Collections became Museum and Collections Services, reporting to the Vice-President (Student and Academic  Services).  The major policy and acquisitions committees continue in their duties.  The organization,  Friends of the University of Alberta Museums, has been established to assist in fundraising and  liaison with the community.

Corporate body	Nexus Theatre		Nexus Theatre was founded as a lunch-hour theatre for downtown Edmonton in the autumn of 1982. The group had originated as a co-operative called Tuesday’s Players, led mainly by David Russell and Linda Pollard. Their initial productions had been the first Edmonton Fringe Festival that summer.     The first year, the group continued to operate as a co-operative. When Russell left to work on his MFA in Directing, Ben Henderson became the first artistic director, in 1983. Henderson, who had just finished his own MFA in Directing, had been a member of the co-op. Many other members joined the original board of directors.     Nexus produced its earliest shows out of the Centennial Library Theatre and the Art Gallery theatre. Evening “dinner theatre” performances were also staged at Sid’s Restaurant.     By 1983, Nexus moved into its own space, downstairs at McCauley Plaza. The space was donated by Alberta Government Telephones (AGT), and provided Nexus with offices and rehersal/performance space. The space was small – seating some eighty people. Under Henderson, Nexus performed original works, commissioned by the theatre.    John Milton Branton, from the Factory Theatre Lab, succeeded Henderson as artistic director in 1987. Branton wanted even more emphasis on new and locally developed shows, finding comedies and musicals the most popular. However, he also mixed original shows with more established pieces, and continued to build on the tradition of a Christmas show begun under Henderson. To get more production into the schedule, Branton initiated a Sunday Brunch series to go with the regular weekday lunch shows and the Friday and Saturday evening performances.     By 1991, when Branton resigned and Earl Klein succeeded as artistic director, the theatre was already showing signs of strain. The limited space and limited show time of some fifty minutes had always limited the box-office, making Nexus Theatre even more dependent on grants and fundraising than most. Other demographic shifts undermined the potential audience, as many corporations in the area shifted to a 30-minute lunch break, and commercial activity in the mall began to decline. Nexus lost its Canada Council funding at this time, based on perceived shortcoming in the program and vision of the theatre, in spite of Klein’s proclamation that Nexus had a mandate to “hold the one-act play in trust.”     Klein resigned in 1993, leaving Nexus dormant for the time being. During this dormant period, AGT withdrew sponsorship of the McCauley Plaza space, evidently rethinking the nature of the mall in light of shifting Corporate body needs and of the mall’s clientele.     Sean Quigley stepped in as artistic director, with Elizabeth Allison as artistic administrator. Nexus tried to work out from under its mounting debt load, and a growing list of creditors, paying off nearly $60,000 in accumulated debts. Nexus was, however, unable to convince AGT to resume sponsorship of the theatre space. The theatre’s position became even more precarious when The Albert Foundation for the Arts withdrew its grant, citing problems with the reporting of funding over the previous two years.     After the dormant period in production during which the financial and space problems absorbed the company’s energies, Quigley tried to put together a season in 1994-95, rehearsing and performing in rented spaces – another expense the company could not afford. Nexus was able to perform only Sexual Perversity in Chicago, at the Roxy in the Autumn of 1994, before having to fold in January of 1995.     The dramatic legacy of Nexus includes over fifty original productions.

Corporate body	Northern Light Theatre		Northern Light Theatre was founded in March 1975 as a lunch-time theatre, modeled after the programming of Vancouver City Stage. The four founding artists were Scott Swan (Artistic Director), Alland Lysell (Administrative Director), and Andela and Merrilyn Gann (Actors).     All were originally from Vancouver, but had come to Edmonton where there seemed a more receptive atmosphere for developing new theatre. NLT’s first presentation was Love and Drollery, a collage of Elizabethan music, prose and poetry, at the Edmonton Art Gallery Theatre. As this production finished, Lysell and Sean also performed Babel Rap, by John Lazarus, in the first program of Citadel Too (also known as Citadel II and Citadel Two), an alternative theatre program John Neville initiated to expand the range of the Citadel Theatre.     Northern Light performed its lunch program for the next five years out of the Edmonton Art Gallery Theatre, which the company had renovated with the help of a $12,000 OFY grant that first summer. The ticket price for that first summer was $1.00.     In 1976, Northern Light added two evening performances each week, so it could offer longer plays. In 1977, Frank Moher was hired as dramaturge, and the company originated a “Playwrights Unit” for reading and workshopping new plays, by such writers as Gordon Pengilly, Tony Bell, Ben Tarver and James DeFelice.     Swan emphasized development of a “house style” of performance, a “lyrical intensity” of presentation and developed ensemble playing in works such as Ten Lost Years and Six War Years.     Among the works that got the Canadian premieres during this early period were David Mamet’s Sexual Perversity in Chicago and Arthur Kopit’s Wings.    In 1980 Northern Light moved to an evening program of full-length plays. Part of the plan was a commitment to originating new Canadian plays with two such works to be commissioned each season. Also in 1980, as part of SummerFest, Northern Light began a summer rep company, Shakespeare in the Park, in a tent on Connors Hill, south of the Muttart Conservatory.     Accumulated debts of some $107,000 forestalled plans for the 1980-81 winter season. The 1981 summer season of four plays added to the debts, leaving the company owning some $130,000. The winter season, 1981-82 had to be cancelled, and Northern Light ceased the SummerFest season in the park.     In late 1981 as well, Swann was hired by Festival Lennoxville, leaving the company without a full-time artistic director. Swan split his time between Lennoxville and Edmonton until Janice van der Veen, from the Vancouver New Play centre, was hired in 1982. In 1983, after a 1982-83 season that was staged in a variety of venues, Northern Light moved to the Kaasa Theatre in the Jubilee Auditorium.     A massive fund-raising campaign cleared off the debts by October 1983.    The Northern Light season became a mix of established, contemporary, and new Canadian works, a season at times much like that of the Phoenix, with whom it shared the Kaasa stage (though Northern Light was more likely to put a new Canadian work into its mainstage season). From 1982, Northern Light also participated in the Alberta Playwrighting Centre, which it co-founded in collaboration with Albert Theatre Projects of Calgary.     By 1987, with the theatre having gradually lost audience, van der Veen and the Northern Light board parted ways, and Gyllian Raby was hired from Calgary’s One Yellow Rabbit Company. Raby’s preference was to explore theatrical form and theatrical image. She initiated a series of collaborative projects, each involving a writer, a composer, a designer and a director. The first such project was Treacheries of the Blue Angel, in June 1989.     In 1991-92, Raby voluntarily took Northern Light off Canada Council operational funding, preferring the flexibility of project funding. Budgetary problems arose that year when a tour of Blake Brooker’s Ilsa , Queen of the Nazi Love Camp was cancelled by court order in mid-run, because of the Jim Keegstra re-trial- Keegstra being a character in the play.     Raby resigned in 1992 to accompany her husband to Halifax. Robert Astle, formerly of Small Change Theatre, succeeded her briefly, before D.D. Kugler took over from 1994 to 1998. By late 1995, Kugler ended Northern Light’s period at the Kaasa to pursue production in “non-traditional theatre venues.”    Although Kugler first attracted attention in March 1995 for a production of Daniel MacIovr’s 2-2 Tango, a piece where movement is the main communicative medium he was highly interested in the spoken word on stage, including adapting poetic works. He carried on a play-reading and development program that took works from early reading through to full production.     Sandhano Schultze, formerly of Pink Ink Theatre of Vancouver, became Artistic Director in May, 1998. His early plans included continuing the play-reading series.	Northern Light Theatre	Scott Swan (Artistic Director), Allan Lysell (Administrative Director), and actors Angela and Merrilyn Gann founded Northern Light Theatre, Edmonton's first lunch-hour theatre company, in 1975. In its early years, operating out of the Edmonton Art Gallery Theatre, NLT developed a reputation for a "house style" of performance and "lyrical intensity" in presentation. NLT's first season presented 18 one-act productions, including musical revues, classics, and Canadian plays both old and new. Throughout the 1970s the company produced an astonishing number and variety of plays every year, showcasing the work of local playwrights, taking on musical comedy, prairie drama, children's theatre and classics. By 1977 NLT was presenting full-length versions of such Canadian landmarks as <i>Ten Lost Years</i> in the evenings, one-act versions at noon, and touring both versions across the prairies. Also in 1977, NLT hired Frank Moher as dramaturge and introduced a "Playrights Unit" for reading and workshopping new plays. From 1982 to 1988 under Jace Van Der Veen's artistic direction, Northern Light joined the growing number of theatre companies who did plays in the Kaasa Theatre at the Jubilee Auditorium. In 1982 NLT strengthened its profile in Alberta's performing arts community when it co-founded, with Alberta Theatre Projects of Calgary, the Alberta Playwrighting Centre. 1988 to 1992 saw deconstructions of the classics like Brad Fraser's updated <i>Revenger's Tragedy</i>, and the spectacular <i>Something Wicked This Way Comes</i>, a theatre-ballet adaptation of Ray Bradbury's science fiction novel. D.D. Kugler took the artistic director's position in 1994. He moved NLT off the Kassa stage and into "non-traditional venues." He continued the company's reputation as a promoter of local artistic talent. From 1994-97 NLT produced nothing but Canadian work. The 1998/99 season saw Lynda Adams returning as Artistic Associate. In his first season as Artistic Director, Sandhano Schultze was nominated for 6 Sterling Awards. NLT celebrated its 25th anniversary in 1999/2000 having established a reputation as an alternative theatre dedicated to development and innovation. That year, Northern Light Theatre won public acclaim for its productions <i>Wreck Beach</i> and <i>Alphonse</i>, which was nominated for two Sterling Awards. The first annual Halloween festival, Carnival of Souls, was presented in the 2000/01 Season. In its first year, the Carnival included the House of Screams, a theatrical haunted house; Urban Tales Cabaret, a Horror Film Fest; and the Kiss of the Dark Costume Ball. The 2000/01 Season also saw the appointment of Al Rasko as the new General Manager. Trevor Schmidt was announced as Northern Light's newest Artistic Director for the 2002/2003 season.	northern-light-theatre.xml

Corporate body	Office of Administrative Data Processing	[ 1967 ] -	The Office of Administrative Data Processing (ADP) was established to serve administrative functions of the University by providing centralized business systems and data processing expertise, and computer data processing production capability. It functioned to examine administrative systems, identify problems, devise improvements, and to help implement recommendations.  In 1967, ADP was mainly responsible for the preparation and processing of punched cards for the accounting systems for student records, staff payroll and student fees. With access to Computing centre facilities, automation was initiated in 1968. By 1969 ADP acquired its own computer, with the agreement that It would provide operational support for the University Library on its hardware. Systems were implemented for payroll, student records, fees accounting, inter-departmental billing, cheque reconciliation, space utilization and inventory, University Bookstore, 3AU Fund, and Alumni Affairs.

Corporate body	Office of the Dean of Students	1976 -	The office of the Dean of Students was created in 1976 to be the “Chief Administrator of the Office of Student Affairs” and Student Services. The Dean answers to the Vice-President (Academic).   The University Act of 1910 vested disciplinary power to discipline students in the University Senate. This was delegated in 1912 to a Committee on Student Affairs, at which point the first position, “Advisor to Women Students,” was created. In 1914 the position of Provost under JM McEachren was created to discipline and regulate the “welfare of the student body.” Discipline was first handled through committees, then appealed to the Committee on Student Affairs.   In 1938 the “Advisor to Women Students” assumed the title “Warden” of Pembina Hall, and in 1951 becomes the “Dean of Women.” The “Professor for Men in Residence” evolved in 1946 to become the Wardens of Athabasca and Assiniboia Halls.  In 1947 an “Advisor to Student Veterans” was appointed, evolving into “Student Advisory Services” in 1950 and later still into “Student Counseling Services”. These positions were responsible to the Provost.   Legislative changes in 1942 vested disciplinary powers in the Dean’s Council with the Committee on Student Affairs dealing with policy matters. Legislative changes in 1966 caused administrative changes leading to the appointment of the Provost to the head the Council on Student Affairs. A 1976 review of Student Affairs lead to the formation of the Council on Student Affairs.  Additional positions were added renamed through the 1960’s such as “Administrator of Student Awards” (1959), “Advisor to Men Students” (1960), “Advisor to Foreign Students” (1960) and “Dean of Men” (1964). In 1966 residential “Wardens” were transformed into “Assistant Deans in Residence”.  The 1976 Voss ad hoc “Committee on the Restructuring of the Office of Student Affairs” made major revisions to the administrative structure.  Note that Student Health Services lies under the auspices of the Vice-President (Finance and Administration.)

Corporate body	Office of the Registrar and Student Awards	1910 - 2009	Dr. H.M. Tory undertook the responsibilities of a Registrar in the first two years of the University’s existence. In 1910, as the number of students expanded into the hundreds, the University appointed Cecil Race the first full-time Registrar. Race performed the duties of Registrar and Librarian in 1910. From 1910 to 1920 he served the dual role of Registrar and Bursar. He continued as Registrar until 1926. The first two decades of operation saw the University rapidly grow in number of courses, programs, and students. Accordingly, the first Assistant Registrar, Mr. G. B. Taylor, was appointed in 1930. Taylor succeeded Ottewell as Acting Registrar in 1945 and as Registrar in 1946. Taylor served as Registrar until 1956.     The Registrar’s Office was housed in two converted classrooms and a small laboratory room on the second floor of the Arts building. The work was divided on a vertical basis. The Registrar was responsible for serving as Secretary of the General Faculty Council and as Secretary of the Senate. From 1946 to 1953 the Assistant Registrar, the Registrar’s Secretary, the Records Clerk, the Scholarship Clerk, and the First Year Committee Clerk all reported to the Registrar. Reporting to the Assistant Registrar were the Admissions Clerk, the Examinations Clerk, and the Professional Examinations Clerk. In 1947-48 the staff consisted of the registrar, the Assistant Registrar, and fourteen clerks and stenographers. In 1956, the Associate Registrar, Mr. Alex Cairns, succeeded Mr. Taylor. He served as Registrar unit 1978. This period witnessed the greatest increase in students and corresponding increase in academic programs in the University’s history. Significant changes followed in both the scope and method of the Registrar’s administrative work. These included: in 1959-60 the newly created Office of the Administration of Student Awards assumed from the Registrar responsibility for scholarships and bursaries; in the same year, the newly created Administrator of Professional Examinations took over responsibility for exams. In 1960-61, electronic data processing began in the Registrar’s Office, several advances in processing records of student grades and courses followed. Amongst these in 1963 a decentralized system of assigning students to classes was introduced in place of the traditional “mass registration,” and in 1968 the Registrar adopted a “nine-point” grading system, and a revised system of weighting courses and of calculating grade-point averages. This resulted in a redesign of a substantial number of recordkeeping forms. Also in 1969 the Registrar relinquished the responsibility for acting as Secretary of General Faculties Council and of its Executive Committee to the newly established University Secretariat. The Registrar remained an ex-officio member of both bodies. In 1969 the Registrar assumed the following significant responsibilities: editing, production, and distribution of University Calendars; management of all centrally scheduled classroom space; and high school liaison. In the early 1970s, changes to the management of student records included: 1971-27, evening credit classes were integrated in day schedules; 1972, first Spring Session introduced; 1973-74, a system of advanced registration is introduced; 1977, the administration of Special Admissions Examinations (NCAT, LAST, TOEFL, etc.) was assumed by the Registrar. In 1972 the Registrar relinquished his duties as Secretary of the Senate and of its various committees to the first full-time Executive Officer of the Senate. From December 1978 to December 31, 1978, the Associate Registrar, Mr. Morgan, served as Acting Registrar. In January, 1980, Dr. W.A. Blanchard, Professor of Psychology, and Associate Dean of Arts since 1972, was appointed Registrar. Brian J. Sizer succeeded him in 1984.

Person	Orrell, John		John Orrell was born on December 31, 1934 at Maidstone, Kent and attended local schools before joining the Royal Air Force, training as a pilot at Moosejaw, Saskatchewan.     He graduated in English from University College, Oxford, returning to Canada to teach English at the University of Toronto, where he completed a M.A. in 1959, and his Ph.D. in 1964; his thesis titled: The Repeated Scene: A Study of Formal Parallelism in Elizabethan Tragedy” He then accepted a position teaching English at the University of Alberta, while also writing plays, screenplays, radio and television documentaries, poems, short stories, and focusing his research on theatre history and architecture. Dr. Orrell was an authority on Elizabethan and Jacobean theatre design, and taught many courses on Shakespeare. He also wrote a book describing Edmonton play and opera houses, and researched a book on Western Canadian words and expressions. In 1989, Professor Orrell was chosen as a recipient of the J. Gordin Kaplan Award for Excellence in Research, and he was named University Professor in 1990.    Professor Orrell took a sabbatical year at Cambridge University in 1974, where he met Sam Wanamaker, an American film director who was staging plays in a tent at the Globe Theatre site. Wanamaker, the prime motivator behind wanting an exact Globe Theatre replica rebuilt, invited Orrell in 1979 to be the principal historical advisor and architectural consultant for the Globe Theatre project and to put together a blueprint planning for the theatre’s eventual reconstruction.     Orrell’s research for planning the Globe Theatre reconstruction involved using new techniques to calculate the approximate size and seating arrangements of the original. There were no existing plans for the original Globe Theatre structures. The theatre first opened in 1599 at Bankside, London, and was the site of the first performances of some of Shakespeare’s greatest works, but burned down in 1613. A replica theatre was immediately rebuilt, to be torn down by the Puritans in 1644. Orrell’s break-through research involved using a famous 17th century etching. “The Long View of London” by artist Wenceslaus Hollar, and overlaying it on a modern map showing which 17th century buildings survived. He then applied trigonometric analyses of building proportions to determine the size of the original Globe Theatre structure. As writer David Martin explains:     Dr. Orrell added a disappointingly small amount of archaeological evidence, Shakespeare’s own stage directions, a building contract for a similar theater, the writings of Italian theater architects and several other contemporaneous images, and came up with a description for the size and nature of the theater. (The New York Times, 28 Sep 2003)    Professor Orrell joined other principal advisors, Richard Hosley, Andrew Gurr and Glynne Wickham, to advise the Globe Project architect, Theo Crosby. His research was published in 1983 as the Quest for Shakespeare’s Globe, followed by a subsequent publication, Rebuilding Shakespeare’s Globe, written with Andrew Gurr. The original foundation for the Globe was discovered in 1989, reconstruction began in 1992, and in 1997 the Globe Theatre reopened. Through all stages of the planning and eventual building of the theatre, John Orrell played an integral part; his contributions, in the words of co-scholar Andrew Gurr, “he’s [Orrell] really one of the pillars, one of the reasons the Globe is here.”    John Orrell died on September 16th, 2003, and is survived by his wife Wendy, and two children, Katherine and David.

Person	Peacock, Gordon	1928 -	"Teacher, Director, Actor – Gordon Bruce Peacock was born in April 1928 in Hanna and grew up in the hamlet of Pibroch in Westlock County Alberta. He began his student days at the University of Alberta in 1945 when he enrolled in an education program. His academic career started at a time when the institution was increasing support to the fine arts. In 1945-46 President Newton endorsed a “tripartite Department of Fine Arts.” The department was divided into “divisions” of music, drama and visual art. Previously the arts were the purview of the Faculty of Extension where Sydney Risk instructed “Dramatics.” Risk became the first head of the Drama division. One of Risk’s first projects was the University Provincial Players (UPP), a touring theatre company that gave performances in small towns across Alberta. Robert Orchard, the first instructor of UofA drama courses, succeeded Risk after a year and continued the UPP tours with Gordon Peacock an enthusiastic member. The 1946 company comprised six actors performing in three separate plays under Orchard’s direction. The tour covered thirty towns concluding with performances at the Banff Centre where Orchard instructed in the summer. Peacock continued in the education program the next three years and his interest in the arts continued to grow. In 1947 Peacock played Feste in the University Drama Society’s production of Twelfth Night, under the Direction of Robert Orchard. By 1949 Peacock’s involvement with student arts groups suggested a future career in the performing arts. He was a member of the UPP (1946-49), a member of the University Drama Club (1945-49), Editor of “On Stage” (1946-47), and President of the Literary Association (1948-49).    In 1950 Peacock pursued graduate studies at the Carnegie Institute of Technology in Pittsburgh. Two years later the institution awarded him a Master of Fine Arts degree in Drama in the “directing option.” With the recommendation of his advisor Henry Boettcher, he returned to Edmonton to look for employment. Although Orchard wished to immediately hire Peacock for the UofA’s newly created Studio Theatre, Peacock initially had to work for the Edmonton Public School Board. Peacock nevertheless directed Studio Theatre’s first production of the season. In 1952 Robert Orchard took a one year sabbatical to study drama in France. In his place Gordon Peacock assumed the responsibilities of lecturer in drama, director of the Drama Division and production manager of the Studio Theatre. The Board of Governors subsequently extended this appointment to August 1955. During this period, Peacock experienced, like Orchard, the need for both a more developed theatre venue than the WWII quonset huts, and a set of senior courses in the drama program because many of the plays contained roles demanding experienced students. After several years of lobbying by Peacock and other members of the drama division, the General Faculties Council (GFC) agreed to support a degree in drama in the Bachelor of Arts program. In the meantime, Robert Orchard resigned in 1955 to be replaced by Peacock who became head of the Drama Division and director of Studio Theatre. During this period Peacock advanced from Assistant Professor in the Division of Drama (1954-1957) to Associate Professor, Drama Division (1957-1964). He also found time to serve as Chairman and instructor in acting at the Banff School of Fine Arts Summer School (1958-1965) and was the founder and first artistic director of Edmonton’s Torches Outdoor Theatre (1962).    Although the GFC approved a BA in drama in 1956-57, the program was not instituted until 1964. In the interim Peacock was forced to make alliances with other arts programs in an effort to share resources. Studio Theatre's 1958 (9th) season was almost cancelled when the WWII quonset huts, Studio Theatre's improvised performance venue, were demolish to make room for Cameron library. Peacock announced they would cancel all public performances for lack of venue. However, the Department found a temporary performance space on a kind offer from Hebert Coutts, Dean of the Department of Education. Studio Theatre and the Drama Department continued operations in a remodelled auditorium and with classroom space in the Education Building (E.A. Corbett Hall) until permanent theatre space was built. Corbett Hall would be Studio Theatre’s “temporary” space solution for the next 30 years. The Drama Department moved out of Corbett Hall in 1989 and it was announced Studio Theatre's new home for the following two years would be the Myer Horowitz stage. Once more, a temporary space became permanent and it was not until 1995 that Studio Theatre moved to its new home in the newly opened Timms Centre. In spite of the resource difficulties, Studieo Theatre quickly gained a national reputation for staging daring and innovative indigenous theater. Notable amongst Studio Theatre's productions was ""Let's Murder Clytemnestra According to the Principles of Marshall McLuhan,"" a play by UofA English Professor and McLuhan collaborator Wilfred Watson. The play drew national attention to both the work of Studio Theatre and the creative work of Wilfred Watson. (see Wilfred Watson's records at the UofA archives for further information.    Eventually, the UofA created the Department of Drama in 1964 and Peacock became the founding chairman, a position he held until 1971 when he returned to full-time teaching. As Peacock observed, the UofA Bachelor of Drama program had a tremendous impact on the development and quality of theatre at the UofA. It was also recognized as a path breaking program on the Canadian drama scene. The Department of Drama created the first professional theatre training programs at a Canadian University: the B.F.A. in Acting (1966), the M.F.A. in Directing and in Design (1968) and the M.F.A. in Playwriting (1969). While serving as Chair of Drama at the UofA Peacock was also Guest Instructor and Director of the National Theatre School of Canada, in Montreal, from 1963 to 1966. He also served from 1969 to 1973 as the guest director of summer theatre at the Pacific Conservatory in Santa Maria, California. In 1976 Peacock returned as Drama Department Chair to fill in for Tom Peacock who was taking a study leave. He filled this position until 1985 when he accepted an offer of the position of Frank C. Erwin, Jr. Centennial Professor of Drama, University of Texas, Austin. A position he has held until the present.    Peacock has also worked on other creative projects during his tenure at the UofA. He was guest instructor in Aesthetics and Theatre History at the Banff School of Fine Arts Summer School, (1971-1981), adjunct Professor of Theatre – University of Tennessee, 1987. He served as principal theatre consultant for Mount Royal College Theatre, Calgary; Eric Harvie Theatre, Banff; and Thrust Theatre at the University of Calgary. He also consulted at York University Theatre Department, University of Victoria Theatre Department, and the Banff Centre for the Arts. In this period Peacock also served as editorial advisor to the Canadian Theatre Review, was a member of the Downey Commission on Advanced Education in Fine and Performing Arts in Alberta, and was the first president of the Canadian Theatre Association (1967-1969).    In his directing career Peacock directed 40 major productions at Studio Theatre, 4 major productions for the Banff School of Fine Arts, one production for the National Theatre School and another for Theatre du Rideau Vert, both in Montreal. He has also directed 4 major productions for the Pacific Conservatory of the Arts, Santa Maria, Ca. and 2 productions for the National Theatre School, Stratford, Ontario.    Peacock lists the following career awards: Canadian Drama Award (1959), The Margo Jones Citation fo New Work (The White House, Washington, D.C., 1964), The Canada Council Artist’s Award (1968), The British Council Research Award (1969), The Edmonton Award for Excellence in the Arts (1971), The Province of Alberta Award for Distinguished Attainment in the Arts (1975), Honorary Doctorate of Laws, University of Alberta, (1990)."

Person	Pearce, William	1848-02-01 - 1930	"A son of United Empire Loyalists, William Pearce was born on February 1, 1848 near Port Talbot, Dunwich Township, Elgin County, Ontario. Following a semester of study, in 1869 he abandoned his studies in engineering at the University of Toronto to take a three-year surveying apprenticeship with Wadsworth and Unwing, a Toronto land surveying firm. During his apprenticeship Pearce worked on surveying assignments in the woods of northern Ontario. His apprenticeship inspired his life-long interest in natural resource and wilderness development and confirmed his professional surveyor's career.   Pearce's professional life divides into three phases: federal surveyor and administrator (1874-1884); federal advisor for western development policy (1884-1904); and western consultant for the Canadian Pacific Railway Company (1904-1928). He received his certification as a Province of Ontario Land Surveyor in October 1872. His professional career began as a transit man for H.D. Lumsden, a railway engineer for the Muskoka Junction Railway. He moved back to Wadsworth and Unwin in January 1873. The company immediately assigned him to the challenging Thousand Island survey project running surveys across open water and ice on the shores of the St. Lawrence River. During his Thousand Island surveying project, Colonel J.S. Denis, Canada's Surveyor General, approached Pearce with an offer to join his staff in the newly-created Dominion Department of the Interior as it began to absorb the vast North American regions of Rupert's Land and the North-West Territories.   The Rupert's Land Act of 1868 began the legislative process to transfer from The Hudsons' Bay Company to the Dominion of Canada Rupert's Land and the North-Western Territory; after two years of geopolitical negotiation the Rupert's Land and North-Western Territory Order admitted the territories into Canada in July 1870. In the following years, strategies to assert Canadian sovereignty and control over this vast region were foundation stones of federal policy. Pearce's professional career was intimately connected to these strategies. Ottawa began to manage the region with the Dominion Lands Act (35 Vic., c. 23, 1872) primarily directed at the parsing of resources and settlement of the Canadian Prairies. The next year Ottawa created the Department of the Interior (36 Vic., c. 4, 1873) thereby assigning a single department administrative jurisdiction over all public and Indian lands west of Ontario.   Following his recruitment, Pearce began his surveying position in the Department of the Interior in Winnipeg, in May 1874. He was responsible to progress with surveys addressing what was commonly known as the ""Outer Two-Mile"" claims. Under the Manitoba Act (33 Victoria, c.3, Canada, 1870) Metis land grants along the Red and Assiniboine Rivers included undetermined and pre-survey settlement claims. The Manitoba Act gave Metis settlers access to hay two miles beyond their defined holdings to feed their livestock. In the shifting settlements, squatting, and rampant land speculation, Pearce attempted to stake out these claims. The ""outer two miles"" question was not settled until 1877, and claims were not staked until 1881 (Dept. of the Interior Annual Report, Canada Sessional Papers, 1882). Following the ""outer two miles"" assignment, in 1878 Pearce moved on to locating township grids, surveying meridians in Manitoba, and determining the International Boundary in the Turtle Mountain area."	Pearce William	Surveyor, Statistician, Administrator, 1848-1930.  William Pearce apprenticed as a surveyor,  joining the Department of the Interior in that capacity in 1874.  By 1884 he was acting as the  Department's chief advisor on the development of the North-West.  Calgary became his  headquarters in 1884 when he was appointed Superintendent of Mines.  His position rapidly became that of troubleshooter, advisor and unofficial promoter for western expansion. He was assigned the  task of settling land claims, particularly those of the Metis and squatters.  Based on this knowledge,  Mr. Pearce prepared the official report on the causes of the Riel Rebellion.  During the next twenty years William Pearce was actively engaged in devising a number of policies designed to control the  development of resources.  These included the creation of stock-watering reserves, establishment of  the system of National Parks, initiation of irrigation projects and passsage of the North-West Irrigation Act.  In 1904 Mr. Pearce left the government service and joined the Canadian Pacific  Railway Company, providing expertise in all fields of resource development, particularly irrigation.  In 1916 he served on the Economic and Development Commission of the Canadian government.  In  his last years, he acted as statistician for the C.P.R.	pearce-william.xml

Person	Peel, Bruce			Peel Bruce	Librarian, Author, 1916-1998. Bruce Braden Peel was born November 11, 1916 on a homestead near Ferland, in southern Saskatchewan, and grew up on the prairies. He earned a teacher's credential and in 1937 began teaching school in rural Saskatchewan, and later in Saskatoon. But he had ambitions which required more education, which the Depression and the outbreak of war served to delay. Although unfit for military service because of his eyes, he nonetheless volunteered, and ended up painting ships at the Lakehead. After returning to Saskatchewan, he took both bachelor's and master's degrees in history, then went east to earn a library degree at the University of Toronto. Returning to the University of Saskatchewan in 1946, he was appointed curator of the Adam Shortt Collection of Canadiana. In 1951 he moved, with his new bride, Margaret (Fullerton), to the University of Alberta Library as chief cataloguer, quickly rose to the position of deputy librarian, and in 1955 was appointed "Librarian to the University." As a library administrator, he guided the growth of the University of Alberta Library from a very modest size to its present rank, as one of Canada's three largest research libraries; planned and developed six library facilities on the Edmonton campus (including the Cameron and Rutherford libraries) as well as the original library collection of the University of Calgary, which was a "branch plant" campus of the U of A until 1965. During this period Mr. Peel also compiled and published Bibliography of the Prairie Provinces to 1953 (1956). He served on seemingly endless library committees and boards, and was president of the Library Association of Alberta (LAA), the Canadian Library Association (CLA), and the Canadian Association of Research Libraries (CARL). In 1982, the year of his retirement, he was honored with the Canadian Library Association's Award for Outstanding Service to Librarianship, the naming of the rare book room the "Bruce Peel Special Collections Library" and later, in 1991, by an honorary doctorate conferred by the University of Alberta. He was instrumental in the creation of both the University of Alberta's library school and its press, and a member of the seminal Symons Commission on Canadian Studies (1976-81), for which he drafted documents on the role of libraries in supporting Canadian studies, and the need for a national microfilming project, known as C.I.H.M. (Canadian Institute for Historical Microreproductions), on whose Board of Directors he also served.  Mr. Peel passed away in 1998. He was survived by his wife Mary, daughter Alison (Nussbanmer), and son Brian.	peel-bruce.xml

Corporate body	Phoenix Theatre		Phoenix Theatre was founded in 1981 under artistic director Keith Digby. Digby had been director of the recently bankrupt Theatre 3, and the legend is that Phoenix Theatre rose from the ashes of that company. Along with an aesthetic relationship with Theatre 3, in terms of the programming of contemporary plays, Phoenix also inherited the offices and telephone number of Theatre 3. Consequently, in its early days one of its main challenges was to clarify its own identity as a separate theatre in order to secure Canada Council and Alberta Culture grants.    Phoenix performed its first season in the Student Union Building (SUB) on the University of Alberta campus. The company proclaimed its five-point program in its first year: contemporary works of a more challenging variety than found in most regional theatres; premiers and new Canadian plays; workshop productions of upcoming plays; new looks at classics; a Christmas family show. Digby resigned early in 1982 to become artistic director of the Bastion Theatre in Victoria. He was succeeded by Bob Baker, a University of Alberta drama graduate with experience at Vancouver’s New Play Centre and the Stratford Festival.     Baker enhanced the contemporary focus by mounting the latest works of Sam Shepard, David Mamet, Christopher Durang, David Hare, Carol Churchill and Jim Cartwright, Stewart Lemoine and Tom Wood. In these years Phoenix became well loved for its inventive fund-raising events organized by the Friends of Phoenix. Baker also sought out a new home for the Phoenix. The 1982-83 season went up in the John L. Haar Theatre in the Jasper Place campus of Grant MacWEwan Community College. The 1983-84 season saw the Phoenix perform its subscription season out of the 200-seat Walter Kaasa Theatre in the Northern Alberta Jubilee Auditorium, a space it would occupy for the next twelve years.     In 1983-84 the Phoenix also moved its offices and rehearsal space to the 4th Floor, 10170 – 100 A st., and initiated its Phoenix Downtown program of new and experimental works. A final move in 1986 took the Phoenix to 9638 – 101 A Ave, with offices and a 100-120 seat alternative playhouse.   Jim Guedo succeeded Baker in 1987. Guedo, a University of Saskatchewan Drama graduate, had founded the Actors Lab in Saskatoon before coming to the Phoenix. Under Guedo the emphasis shifted slightly to emphasize “contemporary controversial” theatre in the main season. New Canadian work was largely shifted to the Downtown venue, though existing Canadian works continued to be features in the main stage season.    The Downtown venue closed after 1993 as government funding sources for the seed program dried up, and the City, which owned the space, began to look for higher rents. The Phoenix eventually moved its offices to the Arts Barns in 1996, renting space from Fringe Theatre Adventures and performing out of a variety of venues.     In 1990, Guedo programmed Our Country’s Good, the first of a series of annual large-cast productions that would include Les Liaisons Dangereuses (1991), Mad Forest (1993) and Sweeney Todd (1994). This last, for example, was budgeted for a $60 - $70,000 loss at the box office. Board-driven fundraising was to make up the deficits in the Phoenix budgets, but it never kept pace with the actual costs of this ambitious program.    By the Time Guedo resigned as artistic director in 1995, the Phoenix had won some 35 Sterling Awards, but was also over $90,000 in debt, and the 1995-96 season was marked by embarrassing cancellations and cost-cutting program changes.   John Cooper arrived from Vancouver in January 1996 to take over as artistic director. He programmed a sixteenth season, and mounted a production of Angels in America, Part I: The Millennium Approaches (cancelled in the previous season). Although the production, staged at the Timms Centre for Performing Arts in October and November, was a success, the Phoenix was by this time some $147,000 in debt, and the Board decided to close down operations.     Cooper was hired in May 1997 as co-director of Theatre Network, as that theatre shifted itrs program to augment its traditional program of new Canadian works with the kind of contemporary and controversial play that had been the Phoenix mainstay.

As Chief of the Department of Ethnography at Toronot's Royal Ontario Museum from 1959/1960, he was acknowledged as a leading authority on Canada's northern Cree, and was the author of dozens of books, articles, pamphlets and films. During 1965-1970 he taught part-time at Toronto and from 1970 on at McMaster University. His focus for his studies was the subsistence patterns and ecology of the Algonkin peoples of sub-arctic eastern Canada. His relationship with the Ojibway and Cree was much more than that of an ethnologist, he was also a friend and associate. Rogers is buried in the Weagamow Lake Indian Reserve Cemetery; the only outsider and non-Indian accorded this privilege.

Person	Romanet, Louis Auguste	1880-08-14 - 1.16.1964	"Louis Auguste Romanet was born in St. Nazaire en Royans in the south of France on 14 August 1880. At the age of 23 he resigned his commission as a cadet-lieutenant in the 144th Infantry Regiment to seek adventure in North America. He joined the French fur trading company, Revillon Freres which was opening trading posts in Labrador, Northern Quebec and the east coast of Hudson's Bay; and was sent by steamer from Quebec City to Ungava. Romanet had wished for adventure and found it on this first journey. There were no accurate charts of the North Atlantic coasts and Arctic waters and the steamer encountered uncharted shoals and rocks, as well as gales, blizzards, and icebergs before she reached her destination. A dwelling house, store and warehouse were constructed by the Revillon employees on the Koksoak River near the Hudsons Bay Companys post at Fort Chimo. When the steamer ""Stord"" returned to England and France on October 20, 1903, the chief trader, his wife and two junior traders, one of them Louis Romanet, were left to manage Revillons first trading post in Northern Canada   Romanet kept journals of his trip to the New World and of his first winter in Northern Canada, in which he described in detail the strange new people, environments, realities and experiences. During his years at the Ungava post he made many trips throughout the province of Quebec keeping in touch with other Revillon posts and the Eskimo and Indian trappers and hunters. He met the daughter of another trader on one of his journeys and they were married in 1908 or 1909. (At the trading posts years were marked, not by calendar but by the arrivals and departures of the supply steamer, so it is difficult for an outsider to discover the exact dates of events.) A daughter was born to the Romanets at the Ungava post.   In 1916 Romanet joined the Hudsons Bay Company as an inspector. At that same time news of the war in Europe finally reached Northern Quebec, and Romanet left his family in care of the Company at Moose Factory while he rejoined his regiment in France. Upon his discharge in 1919 he returned to Canada and began inspection visits throughout Northern Canada from Hudsons Bay to the Pacific Ocean.   After joining the Hudsons Bay Company, Romanet began submitting reports in English, which he had learned more or less efficiently, through his contacts with English-speaking traders and natives. His later reports and the manuscripts of his books show great facility with the language, albeit his secretaries weeded out the French idioms that still appeared in his writing. In 1920 the Hudsons Bay Company marked its 250th anniversary with an essay competition among its employees. Romanet won the contest and $1000.00 prize money.   In 1923,Romanet was promoted from general inspector to district manager of the Athabasca and Mackenzie River Districts and general manager of the Alberta and Arctic Transportation Company. He was responsible for the operation of all the fur trading posts in the two districts and for the Hudsons Bay Company's river transportation craft: stern-wheelers, barges, and motor launches. With headquarters in Edmonton, his office operated out of Peace River to posts above Fort Vermillion and out of Waterways Fort McMurray to Aklavik. He remained district manager until he left the employ of the Hudsons Bay Company in October, 1930.   A meeting with Lowell Thomas in Edmonton, resulted in that author taking over the manuscripts on Romanets autobiography which was published by Thomas in 1932 as Kabluk of the Eskimo. Romanet described the book in a letter to Captain Thierry Mallet of Revillon Freres:   What concerns the Eskimo and the Arctic was taken from my MS. What concerns myself was gathered by Mr. Thomas during my stay at his home in Pawling, N.Y., or drawn from his imagination in certain cases. The events he described to Thomas were ""doctored up and magnified by him, to please the public which he knows so well."""	Romanet Louis Auguste	Fur trader, Author, 1880-1964.  L.A. Romanet came to Canada from France in 1903 as an employee of the fur trading company Revillon Freres.  He began his career at their Ungava post in northern Quebec.  In 1916 he joined the Hudson's Bay Company as an inspector; by 1923 he was sent to Edmonton to be district manager for the Athabasca and Mackenzie River Districts and general manager of the Alberta and Arctic Transportation Company.  In the latter post he had charge of all the Company's river and lake paddlewheel steamboats in the north.  After he left the Company in 1930 Mr. Romanet was employed at various times as an agent for North Star Oil Company, Abasand Oils Ltd (1937-1941) and as an inspector for the Northwest Service Command during World War II.	romanet-louis-auguste.xml

That year they emigrated to Canada where her husband lectured in zoology at the Univeristy of Manitoba for one year, before moving farther west to found and become Head of the Department of Zoology at the University of Alberta. In Edmonton Reta Rowan raised her family of two sons and three daughters and participated in numerous University and community activities for more thatn fifty years. In 1977 she moved to Willowdale, Ontario. Mrs. Rowan died in Toronto on Juen 28, 1983.     Mrs. Rowan's interests were varied, ranging from involvement with cultural groups such as the Folk Festival Committee and the Allied Arts Council, to association with the Alberta Adult Education Society and with the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. It was, however, her work with minority groups at the civic and provincial level that claimed most of her time between 1942 and 1967. She organized the female representatives of nineteen ethnic groups in the city into the Council for Canadian Unity, which she chaired from 1942-1950. When the Council's Committee of the Friends of Indians was formed in 1944 she acccepted the duties of corresponding secretary. Although she resigned this executive position in 1960, she remained a member until 1967 when the Society, acting on a motion from Mrs. Rowan, disbanded and transferred its support to the Indian-Eskimo Association and the Canadian Native Friendship Centre. Through the Friends of the Indians Society she came in contact with the Indian Association of Alberta whose progress she followed as an observer or delegate until 1957 when she was appointed to its advisory board.

Corporate body	Special Sessions	1919 -	Special Sessions organizes and administers the instructional delivery of programs of other academic units. It provides extra-sessional credit courses through Spring Session, Summer Session and the Off-Campus Credit Program, at both undergraduate and graduate levels, to full-time students, and in cooperative programs, such as those with the Department of Adult, Career and Technology Education, faculte St-Jean, and Athabasca University's Sunrise Project.  in 1919 the University, through the Special Sessions Office, became involved in teacher education, conducting a modest-sized summer program in cooperation with the provincial Department of Education (the latter had been using classrooms on the University Campus since 1913, to hold classes during the summer months for teachers who wished to upgrade their education).  In 1950 the first evening credit courses were offered through the University. Classes were held at three locations: on the Edmonton campus, in Calgary and in Lethbridge. A University Senate committee on evening courses was formed; its terms of reference included responsibility both for credit courses, offered by Special Sessions, and noncredit courses offered by the Department of Extension. The Evening Credit Division Program was administered by the Department of Extension until 1955-1956, when J.W. Gilles, Director of Summer Session, was appointed its coordinator, and a new committee for the program was established whose terms of reference included only those matters dealing with credit courses.  When a University of Alberta campus was established in Calgary, it was made responsible for administration of the Evening Credit Program in the southern part of the province. in 1965 the Summer Session and Evening Program committees were amalgamated on a recommendation of the general Facilities Council.  The operations of Special Sessions were consolidated in the early seventies and a new program, Spring Session, was implemented, modelled after the Summer Session Program. The first classes were held in May-June 1972. Integration of late afternoon and evening credit courses held on campus into the general operations of the University was approved in 1970. Courses became the responsibility of the school/faculty concerned. Off-campus credit courses remained extra-sessional, and continued to be administered by the Office of Special Sessions un until 1977, when responsibility for the program was divided between the Office of the Registrar (student recruitment, community contacts, handling local problems with courses, and establishing cooperation with other institutions), and the Special Sessions Office (courses, instructors, dealing with faculties and departments).  in 1983 special Sessions became part of the Faculty of Extension (PAACR,1987).

Corporate body	Students' Union		The Students' Union is an organization composed of students at the University and its affiliated colleges and schools, and includes all societies, clubs and associations established under the authority of the constitution of the Union. The Chancellor, the Senate, members of the Board of Governors, the faculty and the members of the Alumni Association are honorary members of the Students' Union. The Union provides for the administration of the affairs of the students at the University, including the development and management of student institutions and the promotion of the general welfare of students consistent with the purposes of the University. The Students' Council is the legislative, administrative and executive body of the Union. It exercises powers conferred under the Universities Act, subject ot such limitations as are set out in its constitution.	University of Alberta Students' Union	Student government at the University of Alberta was established in the university's first semester with the creation of a student council with F. Stacey McCall as its first president. By 1920, due to the almost full autonomy the council had been granted by University President Dr. Henry Marshall Tory, student council had changed its name to the University of Alberta Students' Union. The student union published the Gateway Newspaper, the Evergreen and Gold Yearbook, enforced most rules of student discipline, and sponsored sports teams and other activities. Over the years, the University of Alberta Students' Union has evolved into one of Canada's strongest student associations; the Students' Union represents the 25,000 undergraduate students at the University of Alberta. An eight-million dollar organization with hundreds of paid and volunteer staff, the SU is a powerful advocate for students and a major provider of student services. The SU also operates a number of business units, manages various targeted 'trust' funds, hosts a wide variety of entertainment and educational events, and runs the Students' Union Building.  All University of Alberta undergraduates are members of the Students' Union. The SU has always been an advocate for students, and has long history of improving student life, such as building SUB and HUB Mall and successfully advocating for increased student representation at the Board of Governors and General Faculties Council. In recent years, the Students' Union has created a number of new services such as Safewalk and the Student Financial Aid and Information Centre; established the Legacy, Access , Student Involvement Endowment, and Campus Rec Enhancement Funds; opened new businesses; renovated SUB twice; and helped advocate for reduced bus pass prices and for increases to the education tax deduction. In 2002, after nearly a century of publication by the SU, the responsibility of publishing the Gateway Newspaper was taken away from the SU and published independently. Past SU alumni include such persons as former Alberta premiere Peter Lougheed (SU President, 1951-52), former Canadian Prime Minister Joe Clark (Gateway Editor-in-Chief, 1959-60), and a former U of A Dean of Law, Tim Christian (President, 1970-71).	university-of-alberta-students-union.xml

Corporate body	Technocracy Inc.			Technocracy Inc	The Technocratic movement was started by Howard Scott, an American engineer, in 1919. In that year, Scott and a number of other scientists and engineers, impressed by American mobilization efforts during the First World War, organized a group known as the Technical Alliance to conduct a survey of the of the potentialities of the American Economy in peacetime. The group was renamed Technocracy in 1930 and in 1932, its basic findings were published. In 1933, Technocracy was incorporated in New York State as a non-profit organization with Howard Scott as its director in chief. The objects of the new organization were: to carry out on a program of economic research; to bring technocratic theory to the attention of the public; and to provide a skeleton organization capable of forming the Technate of North America in the event of a final collapse of the social and economic order based on the price system. From the beginning the movement disavowed revolutionary and political activities. Scott began touring North America and soon chapters were formed in many North American centres including Calgary and Edmonton. The movement gained strength throughout the 1930s but in 1940, due to its stated opposition to the Second World War, was banned in Canada. The ban was lifted in 1943 when Technocracy modified their opposition to the war and sections were re-formed accordingly. However, the post-war years, perhaps due to continued economic prosperity saw membership and interest in Technocracy decrease. Though, relatively insignificant the movement has continued on into the early years of the 21st century.	technocracy-inc.xml 
Corporate body	Technology Entrepreneur and Company Development Edmonton	2004 -	A technology transfer office was formed in 1994 and called the Industry Liaison Office (ILO). This office was a unit of the University and had two main components: the Technology Transfer group (for protecting IP and licensing inventions) and the Contracts group (for finalizing the contracts between researchers and grant awarding organizations, and other agreements).    In 2002, the ILO begun an amalgamation with two other University units to create the Research Services Office (RSO). This move united the Contracts team (of the ILO) with the Research Grants Office and parts of the University's Financial Services.     In 2004, the RSO commenced the present phase to 'spin out' the Technology Transfer Program and re-establishes a distinct storefront for their activities. At the same time, the Company Development program was enhanced (now called JumpStart) to assist University spinoff companies growth. These two units moved into the Research Transition Facility to be closer to the spinoff companies they helped create and nurture.    TEC Edmonton was formed in 2004 as a joint venture between the University of Alberta and Edmonton Economic Development Corporation (EEDC). The move amalgamated two main University units (the Technology Transfer Program and the Spinoff Company Development Program) with two initiatives launched by EEDC (Deal Generator and the VenturePrize Business Plan Competition). This new joint venture was ratified by Edmonton City Council and the University's Board of Governors in 2006.

He entered the University of Saskatchewan and graduated in 1940 with high honors in history and economics (BA). In 1941, he completed his MA thesis, ""Constitutional Development of the North-West Territories, 1870-1888"".     In 1946, he married Margaret E. Telford, and they had two children, Jean and Robert.    Following a period of research employment in the Department of History, University of Saskatchewan, he was appointed in 1946 Assistant Provincial Archivist for the Province of Saskatchewan. During this time he also lectured in history at Regina College. In 1948, he was appointed Provincial Archivist of Saskatchewan, a position which he held until 1957. His work with the Saskatchewan Archives Board involved drafting the first archival legislation for the Province of Saskatchewan, and establishing the policies and procedures governing the two provincial archives offices in Regina and Saskatoon. It was in this period of time that Dr. Thomas completed his doctoral studies under Professor A.L. Burt at the University of Minnesota (1953). His thesis was later published as The Struggle for Responsible Government in the North-West Territories, 1870-97, and became a classic reference for this period of government development in Western Canada.     Between 1957 and 1964 Dr. Thomas served as Associate Professor of History at the Regina campus. His history, The University of Saskatchewan, 1909-1959, was complemented by a number of articles related to archival development in Canada; exploration; and Saskatchewan history.     In 1964, Dr. Thomas joined the Department of History at the University of Alberta in Edmonton. Recognized as Professor of History in 1965, he also became departmental chairman, 1965-1968. In 1975, his The Renaissance of Canadian History: A biography of A.L. Burt was published.     During his career, Dr. Thomas contributed six scholarly books, and numerous articles to the understanding of Canada's past. As editor of Saskatchewan History, 1949-1957, he established an outstanding journal of regional history. In 1968 he was appointed to a three-year term as Alberta's representative on the National Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada. This appointment was renewed for five years in 1971. His leadership in the profession and in linking the world of scholarship to the Canadian public was recognized on many occasions.     In 1972, the University of Saskatchewan awarded Dr. Thomas an honorary doctorate of laws, which was followed by the American Association for State and Local History's Award of Merit. In 1975, he received, ""for outstanding contribution to Alberta history"", the award of the Historical Society of Alberta. During the Learned Societies Conference in Saskatoon, June 1979, the Saskatchewan Archives Board honored Dr. Thomas at a special dinner. Following the dinner, the Canadian Historical Association made him an honorary life member. In 1982, Dr. Thomas was also awarded honorary life membership in the Archives Society of Alberta, and in October of 1982, he received the Order of Canada.     Upon his retirement from the University of Alberta in 1982, Dr. Thomas donated his papers to the University's archives. Post-retirement activity saw Dr. Thomas research and prepare for publication, studies on socialism in Western Canada. A book about William Aberhart and Social Credit in Alberta was published in 1977, and his last completed project was editing tape transcripts resulting in the publishing of: The Making of a Socialist, The Recollections of T.C. Douglas in 1982. Dr. and Mrs., Thomas retired to Regina, Saskatchewan, and Dr. Thomas died there on November 17, 1982."	Thomas Lewis Herbert	Lewis H. Thomas was born April 13, 1917 in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.  A graduate of the University of Saskatchewan with high honours in history and economics, Dr. Thomas obtained his PhD from the University of Minnesota.

The Council also has authority over the administration of professional examinations. The University Act, as revised in 1910, provided the University of Alberta with the power to arrange with the incorporated professional associations or societies in the province which had the legislated right to prescribe examinations for candidates  applying for registration in such societies, to administer and  conduct the examinations, appoint examiners, and report results  to the societies.  Any incorporated professional society could  apply for such arrangements, or administer its own examinations  and accreditation procedures. Between 1942 and 1955 the responsibility for overseeing the  examinations was held by the General Faculties Council at the  University; between 1955 and1966 GFC delegated this authority to the Board of Examiners of each profession.  The substantial reorganization of higher education under the Universities Act of 1966 created the Universities Coordinating Council, which received jurisdiction over the conditions of entrance to cooperating  learned professions and callings.	universities-coordinating-council.xml

Corporate body	University of Alberta Libraries		The University Senate created the University Libraries in 1909. The original collection featured general reference works and required readings for arts and science courses. The collection also contained Canadian books donated to the Library by Dr. A.C. Rutherford. The first library reading room was established in the Guggan St. public school (now Queen Alexandria), the location of the first university classes. The University Senate originally allocated $5,000 to purchase books for a library and endeavored to continue a steadily growing library resource.     In 1911, Athabasca Hall was completed. It was used as a combined residence and teaching building. The library was located on the third floor. By this year, through gifts and Senate funds, the Library had acquired a collection of 6,000 books plus leading magazines and newspapers. There were also reference books available for consultation. The Arts building was opened in 1915. It maintained a library reading room in Room 110. The stack room was located on the floor below. During this decade, the Library collections grew slowly with the help of private donations.     The Library continued its slow growth through the 1920s. Under D.E. Cameron the Library introduced a $5.00 registration fee for the Library. This was the principal source for books until 1958-1959. The accessions reached 30,000 in 1928 and by 1932 it held 45,085 volumes. In 1928 the Edmonton Academy of Medicine transferred its collection of medical books to the University. This promoted the Library into the chief resource library for medical practitioners across the province. The Library published its first report in 1928. A feature of the first report was a description of the Library binding service, initially performed by Mr. Pyewell. This service continued on campus until 1959 when the service was tendered to private companies. By 1963-64, over two thirds of the 6400 bound volumes were bound off campus. The library experienced space problems throughout the 1920s. Due to lack of space in the Arts building, in 1922 the agricultural and medical reading rooms were moved to other spaces. In 1923 new, separate space was set up for a law library. Ad hoc space solutions continued for the next twenty years while acquisitions and students accumulated.     Between 1930 and 1939 the University added approximately 25, 000 volumes. The Library continued its book acquisition through the Depression thanks largely to its registration fee. In 1932 it received a Carnegie Corporation grant of $15,000 to purchase books. As space problems continued the Library began to store books in underground passages. The postwar era brought resources to the Library and responsibilities and services increased. The university Librarian assumed direction of the Edmonton Normal School library when the Faculty of Education took responsibility for all provincial teachers training. The influx of veterans raised the student population to 3,300. The reading room capacity remained 285. Thousands of Education books were taken out of storage in the summer of 1946 to address demand. In 1946, librarians were given academic status and a new salary scale. In Calgary the University Library acquired post-war era independence over acquisition and services. The Calgary education library was reclassified in the Dewey system between 1947 and 1948. The demand for library services in Calgary increased with the growing curriculum. Until 1960, Edmonton campus processed all ordering and classifying for the Calgary library. By 1958, as curriculum changed, the Calgary Library was again reclassified using the Library of Congress system. This project was completed in 1960. By 1963, the Calgary Library was operating in complete independence of Edmonton.     In the winter of 1945-46 the plans continued for a new library building. Honorable John Campbell Bowen, Lieutenant-Governor of Alberta, laid the cornerstone for the new library on November 25, 1948. The Rutherford Library was completed in May 1951. 150,000 volumes from various reading rooms on campus were moved to the new building in eight days. Considerable policy, procedure and services were formulated with the new facility’s arrival: 1952 saw the first fines for reserve books; the following year new geography courses initiated a library map collection; the Library Committee was reconstituted.

Corporate body	University of Alberta Studio Theatre	1949 -	"In 1949, University of Alberta drama professor Robert Orchard, with the help of Elizabeth Sterling Haynes and other University staff and students, created a 149 seat theatre in two deserted Second World War Quonset huts. The Quonset huts, placed side by side, contained between them a stage, auditorium, workshop, drama offices and foyer. Studio Theatre was established as a ""laboratory"" for students taking courses in the Drama Division; it provided a first-hand opportunity for students, teachers and drama technicians to practice their craft and hone their skills. The following excerpt, printed in a 1961-62 Studio Theatre production program, echoes this sentiment:     ""Studio Theatre is the producing organization of the Drama Division, University of Alberta. The aim of the division in all its work is to teach living theatre, and to present a rich stage experience through the medium of important historical and contemporary plays.""     Early participants in Studio Theatre included Robert Orchard, Gordon Peacock, Bert Pullinger, Frank Glenfield, Elizabeth Sterling Haynes, Don Pimm, and Tom Peacocke. Studio Theare was operated by the staff of the Drama Division of the Department of Fine Arts, and the Division offered a Bachelor of Arts in Drama. As well, students in the Faculty of Education could elect drama as their major field of study, and a six-week summer session in drama was established. The first play produced on the Quonset stage was Henry IV, and starred Robert Orchard. Gordon Peacock also had a part. Studio Theatre operated out of the Quonset theatre quarters for eight seasons, producing over 40 full-act plays, numerous one-act plays, offering two world premieres and six Canadian premieres. Studio Theatre actors won a regional drama festival in 1953 with their production of Othello. However, increasing enrollment at the University of Alberta meant that the land occupied by the Quonset huts was needed for an expanding University building program, and the huts were torn down in May of 1958. Without another building to go to, the Drama Department announced that the ninth season for Studio Theatre would be cancelled.     In fact a ninth season of production did occur because of an offer of space made by the Faculty of Education. Studio Theatre was provided with the use of a remodeled auditorium and with classroom space in the Education Building (E.A. Corbett Hall) until permanent theatre space was built. Although the University drama community in 1959 was very optimistic that permanent theatre space would soon be a reality, Studio Theatre ended up operating out of Corbett Hall for thirty more years. Productions were viewed as very much 'community' events. Drama students, staff, alumni, and guest performers and directors from the local community and beyond were all featured on the Studio Theatre stage. Studio Theatre performed out of Corbett Hall through June of 1989, winding up its 40th season anniversary with Michael Frayn's Benefactor just prior to the closing of Corbett Hall for renovations on June 17, 1989. The announcement was made that Studio Theatre's new home for the following two years would be the Myer Horowitz stage. Again, forecasts of length of time at the site were underestimated, and it wasn't until 1995 that Studio Theatre moved to its new home in the newly opened Timm's Centre.     Studio Theatre, rapidly approaching its 50th anniversary of operation, continues to provide Edmonton audiences with a varied and unique theatre experience. It also continues to serve as a showcase for students graduating from the professional training programs in acting, directing, design, construction, and costuming. Many of the people who gained experience on the Studio Theatre stage have gone on to establish careers in the theatre world."

The Publications Office split from Public Relations in 1968, and the following year a fund Development Office was established, so that by 1970 four separate of ices were in place (Alumni, Public Relations, Publications, and Fund Development). During the 1970s several appraisals were carried out on the four offices, and in 1978 all but the Alumni Office were amalgamated into a new Office of Community Relations. The Fund Development Office separated again in 1981. The office was renamed Public Affairs in 1986.    The records reflect the Office's chief roles as the central public relations unit providing media and community relations services, publications, public relations consultation services for academic and administrative units as well as committees, and graphic design services (PACCR, 1984).

In the mid 1970s, a separate and smaller office was established to support the Board. Board committees are supported by the Board Office, by the Vice-Presidents' Offices, or by the University Secretariat. University of Alberta Faculties frequently propose changes to their courses and programs as listed in the University Calendar. The University Secretariat then circulates these proposed changes throughout the University community.	University of Alberta University Secretariat	To aid in the administration of the committees and bodies that oversee the University a central office has been created to ensure that records are maintained and that administration proceeds in an orderly fashion. The Secretariat is responsible for keeping the records of the General Faculties Council and its committees, Deans' Council, Chairmen's Council, the President's Committees and other bodies as delegated.  Prior to its creation each body would have been responsible for its own administration.  These matters were largely arranged by the President's office. Secretaries: 1969-1981 Margaret M.

Person	Watson, Wilfred	1911 - 1998	"Wilfred Watson was born in Rochester, England in 1911, the oldest child of Frederick Walter Watson and the former Louisa Claydon. He immigrated to Canada with his family at the age of fifteen, settling in Duncan, British Columbia. After one year of highschool, he found a job with a Vancouver Island sawmill. Watson attended the University of British Columbia from 1940 to 1943, earning a B.A. in English literature. During the Second World War, he served in the Canadian navy; after the war he continued his education at the University of Toronto, receiving an M.A. in 1946 and a Ph.D. in 1951. In 1949, Wilfred Watson was employed as a special lecturer in English at the University of British Columbia and from 1951 to 1953 he became professor in the Department of English at the University of Alberta, teaching at the Calgary campus. In 1954, he transferred to the Edmonton campus, remaining there as Professor of English until his retirement in 1977.    Wilfred Watson married Sheila Martin Doherty in 1941, who as Sheila Watson published The Double Hook in 1959. The Watson's both taught at the University of Alberta and participated in an intellectual circle that included the painter Norman Yates, and actor-directors Gordon Peacock and Thomas Peacocke among others (see Stefan Haag, M.A. thesis). Watson co-founded the Jazz Club ""Yardbird Suite"" in Edmonton in the early 1960's, and joined the editorial group of White Pelican (a quarterly review of the arts) in 1972. Wilfred Watson retired from the University of Alberta in 1977 and moved in 1980 to Nanaimo, B.C. with his wife Sheila. He passed away very shortly after his wife Sheila in Nanaimo in 1998, at the age of 87.    Wilfred Watson's writing career was prolific and continuously evolving and developing. T.S.Eliot accepted his first volume of poetry, Friday's Child, for Faber and Faber, publishing it in 1955, and Watson received the 1955 Governor General's Award for it.    He lived in Paris, 1955-1956, as the recipient of a Canadian Government Overseas Fellowship. Here he was introduced to the theatre of the absurd, and in the following years explored this interest with his own writing and directing activities. In the early 1960s, Watson made contact with Marshall McLuhan and developed a growing interest in McLuhan's theories, culminating with their collaboration on the study, From Cliche to Archetype. Watson started work on his first major play, Cockcrow and the Gulls, in the mid-1950s, and it was first performed at the University of Alberta's Studio Theatre in March 1962. Studio Theatre, where Thomas Peacocke and Gordon Peacock were both associated, was an important venue for the production of Watson plays.    During the 1960s Watson had his most prolific period of playwriting; Trial of Corporal Adam was produced in 1963; Wail for two Pedestals in 1964; and Let's murder clytemnestra according to the principles of marshall mcluhan in 1969. A play for Canada's centennial, O holy ghost, dip your finger in the blood of Canada, and write, I love you was produced in 1967. (For a complete listing of Watson's works, please refer to the Watson biography file at the University of Alberta Archives) During the 1970s, Watson concentrated on writing poetry, and his second volume of poetry, The Sorrowful Canadians and Other Poems was published in 1972. This volume of poetry experimented with using different typefaces and repetitions, and Watson later introduced Number-grid Verse in a volume titled I Begin With Counting. Number-grid verse involved a configuration that combines numerals and words juxtaposed on the page; this form allowed Watson to score poetry for oral performance by several voices. A second volume of number-grid verse, Mass on Cowback, was published in 1982.    The 1980s also saw Watson return to writing for the stage; The Woman Taken in Adultery, a short play, was performed at the Edmonton Fringe Festival in 1987 and a major play trilogy, Gramsci x 3 was produced by Studio Theatre in 1986. The number-grid verse concept was applied to these later plays as well. Wilfred Watson also wrote some short stories, essays, and a novel, although a lot of what he wrote was never published. In her article on Wilfred Watson for the Gale Dictionary of Literary Biography, Diane Bessai writes: ""Wilfred Watson, playwright, poet, teacher, and literary theorist, has steadily conducted a one-man revolution in Canadian letters from the 1950s to the present.""(pp 382)"	Watson Wilfred	Wilfred Watson was born in England in 1911 and immigrated to Canada with his family at the age of fifteen, settling in Duncan, British Columbia.

Person	Wheeler, Anne	1946 -	Writer, Director, Filmmaker – Anne Wheeler was born in Edmonton, Alberta, in 1946. She grew up in Edmonton where she enjoyed exploring the country north of the capital with her pony. As a youth she enjoyed music and drama, taking the lead in her school plays and touring with a children's theatre company during the summers. Following high school, Wheeler pursued a B.Sc. in mathematics at the University of Alberta (UofA). She completed her degree in 1967. Upon graduation Wheeler travelled Western Europe and the Middle East. On her return she enrolled in a music program with the goal of pursuing a career in music and drama as a high school music teacher. Wheeler received her music teaching certificate in 1969. She resumed travelling and returned to Edmonton in 1971 after exploring more areas of the Middle East and Africa. On her return she began a Masters in music education at the UofA. During her UofA graduate studies Wheeler began to pursue her interest in filmmaking. She joined Film West Associates, a collective of independent filmmakers sharing a passion for filmmaking, a dearth of experience, and an interest in creating films about the West. After five years and several award winning short films, the cooperative started to dissolve. By then Wheeler was prepared to completely leave music teaching to continue filmmaking. In this period she worked predominantly with the National Film Board and in 1976 she participated in the establishment of the NFB’s North West Centre in Edmonton. Wheeler produced several films in her association with the NFB. These included Great Grandmother (1975), Augusta (1976), Happily Unmarried (1977), Teach Me to Dance (1978), and A War Story (1982). A War Story proved to be a watershed in her career. The film garnered many international awards, among them the Blue Ribbon Award at the American Film Festival (1983).    Beyond filmmaking Wheeler also found time to start a family. She married Garth Hendren and in 1979 had twin boys, Quincy and Morgan.    In the early 1980s the National Film Board (NFB) released all directors from its staff. Although Wheeler worked as both a producer and director at the NFB, she decided to quit for the opportunity of independent filmmaking. Her first post-NFB effort was A Change of Heart (1983), a film she co-wrote with Anne Frank. Produced for the CBC, it was Wheeler’s first entirely dramatic film, a new direction for her art. Wheeler followed this film with Loyalties (1985), her most critically acclaimed work. The work won several awards including: Portugal Film Fest, Best Actress; France, Critic's Choice; Quebec, Critic's Choice. It was also her first dramatic feature film. Bye Bye Blues (1989), Wheeler’s next film, is her greatest commercial success to date.    Wheeler moved to Salt Spring Island in 1990 and became more closely involved with the film and television industry in Vancouver. This was a time when Wheeler expressed difficulty finding funding to produce feature length films. Accordingly, the move to the coast initiated a string of television works, particularly for the CBC, including The Diviners (1993), The War between Us (1994), Mother Trucker, Diana Kilmury: Teamster (1996), The Sleep Room (1997), and North of 60. In 1998, Wheeler directed the first three episodes of Da Vinci's Inquest. The CBC series continues in the successful style she established. In 1993 Wheeler had her first work produced in an American context. Working with producers Eileen Berg and Harold Tichner, Wheeler directed the made for television movie Other Women's Children, for A.B.C. In cooperation with Crescent Films, the movie won a Cable Ace Award for Performance. It was later aired on Lifetime in the United States, and Superchannel/C.B.C. in Canada.    In 1999 Wheeler made Better than Chocolate working with Telefilm Canada, Rave Film Inc., and the British Columbia Film Commission. It was a return to feature films and comedy. The film was a popular and critical success on an international level. She followed this with three more dramas, Marine Life (2000), Suddenly Naked (2001) and Edge of Madness (2002). The first two continued Wheelers’ exploration of traditional relationships and sexual convention, the latter returns to her interest in the women’s experience of early Prairie life.    Wheeler has continued her work in both television and film. Recent television works include A Sleep Room, The Investigation (2002) and This is Wonderland.   Wheeler continues to write, direct and produce films. She has also started teaching at the University of British Columbia. She currently lives in White Rock with her family. To date, she boasts six honorary doctorates and an Order of Canada in recognition of art.	Wheeler Anne	Writer, Director, Filmmaker. 1946-.  Anne Wheeler was born in Edmonton, Alberta, in 1946. Upon completing high school, Ms. Wheeler entered the University of Alberta, graduating with a B.Sc. in Mathematics in 1967. During her twenties, Ms. Wheeler was employed at a variety of careers including computer programming, teaching high school and acting. In 1971, Ms. Wheeler joined a collective of nine individuals determined to document in film the trials and tribulations of life in Western Canada. The collective, entitled Film West, and with no previous filmmaking experience, was within a year winning awards from major film festivals for their documentaries. In 1976, Ms. Wheeler left the collective and continued her career in film as a freelancer, primarily by writing and directing documentaries and short films for the National Film Board of Canada.  In 1981, she wrote and directed her first feature film, A War Story (1981), starring Donald Sutherland and based on her father's experiences as a doctor in a Japanese Prisoner of War camp. Ms. Wheeler has gone on to produce numerous other feature films including Bye Bye Blues (1990), Better Than Chocolate (1999), Loyalties (1984) and Angel Square (1989). Ms. Wheeler has also directed several vehicles for television including a Movie of the Week adaptation of Margaret Laurence's The Diviners (1990) which received a Genie Award for best M.O.W. in 1990. Ms. Wheeler has also directed episodes of Canadian television dramas such as Davinci's Inquest and Cold Squad. Ms. Wheeler's works have received acclaim and won awards in Canada, the United States, and Europe, and she has been the recipient of six honorary doctorates including her alma mater, the University of Alberta in 1990.

Corporate body	Workshop West Theatre		Workshop West Theatre was founded in 1978 by Gerry Potter, MFA, University of Alberta, with a three-fold mandate: participate in the growing new Canadian Theatre; provide more stage access for Alberta playwrights; develop playwrighting talent in Alberta.     As part of this program the Playwrighting Circle was actually in operation before the theatre staged its first production. In the early years, new plays were not necessarily developed for first production by Workshop West, but this practice changed by the mid-1980s, inspired in part by the success of Theatre Network in developing and staging new works. In 1985, Workshop West initiated a short-lived “Playwriting Ensemble,” of eight theatre artists. Over the next two years the ensemble worked collaboratively to produce new collective works (e.g. It’s Your Turn to Get Up) and to adapt stories from other media (e.g., Sweatlodge Tales and The Rich Man). In 1986, Workshop West unofficially changed its name to Workshop West Playwright’s Theatre, a name that appeared sporadically on programs and publicity for the next five years.     In January 1995, while on leave, Potter resigned as Artistic Director. His legacy includes four Sterling Awards for Outstanding New Play, two Governor General’s Award nominations, and one Chalmers Award. Among the important playwrights to have worked at or been produced at Workshop West during Potter’s term were Frank Moher, Brad Fraser, Raymond Storey, Conni Massing and Stewart Lemoine. David Mann, who was already serving as an interim leave replacement, succeeded Potter as Articstic Director. Mann continued the Springboards New Play Festival that originated in March 1995 as part of the new work development process.     Workshop West has operated out of several venues. In its early years, it suffered from lack of a regular home. It moved into the Kaasa Theatre in the Northern Alberta Jubilee Auditorium in the 1983-84 season, and operated from that space until the 1996-97 season. In 1996-97, one show was staged at the Kaasa; one at the Roxy, a co-production with Theatre Network (whose home is the Roxy); and two at the 3rd Space, at 11516-103 st. (the home of Northern Light Theatre). In the 1997-98 season, Workshop West moved out of the Kaasa completely, to produce out of the Roxy and the 3rd Space.
