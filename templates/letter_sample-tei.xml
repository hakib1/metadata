                <p>When leaving you in <placeName sameAs="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1743591">Dunmore</placeName>, I promised to write immediately on my arrival &amp; I hasten to fulfill the very pleasant task I imposed upon myself. I reached home safe &amp; sound &amp; rather tired, after a trying journey. As I was not expected until later, the welcome I received was all the warmer. You cannot imagine how long the days seemed to me. Thursday, I did my best to try &amp; read one of the books you gave me &amp; before I was aware of it the book would be closed &amp; I was once more with you. The different occasions we were together, the words you said &amp; all our plans would flash through my mind &amp; bring me back many a happy moment. I wondered to</p>
                <pb n="2"/>
                <p>myself if you were as busy as I was.. Friday was more pleasant far as the car itself was concerned – I made a few acquaintances, among them a Mr. Jenkins, a young Calgary rancher, who was introduced to you there some time a year ago. He recognized you &amp; having heard that you were engaged to a Miss H___ some two months ago, concluded I was the lady in question. We struck up a conversation &amp; he proved a very great friend to me, on your account. Saturday before reaching Port Arthur I wrote Mrs. Mac. a card as she will have told you. Well, the conductor who came on after we left the [Caller] place looked at my ticket &amp; asked me if the other had not told me to change [it]. I said no. Well, said he, it is of no use. I was of, course, taken aback &amp; did not know what to do. [Mr. Jenkins] seeing it, asked me if he could oblige me in any way &amp; requested</p>
                <pb n="3"/>
                <p>as a favor, to be allowed to supply the funds – which amounted to almost forty dollars. I had quite sufficient for expenses, but not enough to pay that sum. I immediately on my arrival in Montreal, I went to the C. P. R. Office &amp; explained, producing my receipts. They refunded the money at once to my delight as Mr. Jenkins was to leave at three for New York, from where he sails tomorrow for a six months visit to England – he met me there, &amp; he squared every-thing. he was so kind, that I shall always feel grateful. There were also another gentleman &amp; lady on board, who wished to oblige me, but as Mr. Jenkins knew you, I thought he would feel more like trusting me, for your sake so you see how much good your coming to the train did me. The Porter was also to blame, &amp; did, all in his power to make up for his negligence, even going so far as to wish to lend me the money, as “he knew the Majah very well” – he felt very bad over the whole affair. Enough of that, except that I must tell you, that my coolness &amp; self-possession made people admire me &amp; Mr. J___ said, “I was a splendid girl &amp; could travel the world over, being so independent &amp; decided” – You will be pleased to know that you have not made a mistake in my character. Friday we reached Winnipeg at four. Mr. Gautier met me &amp; was so nice – my other friends also. I had almost given up seeing Mr. Steele, when Mr. G___ brought him up – he will have written you about our interview, but you must tell me if he was favorably impressed – I found him very nice – he looks like Julia, but delicate. We reached Montreal at eight Monday morning – the weather here is very mild, &amp; no snow worth mentioning – They found me looking well, but tired. The news of your attention to me found its way down here long ago. [Mr. Col] Hughes
