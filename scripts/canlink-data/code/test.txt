ABSTRACT
 
The qu
estion tha
t this study addressed
 
wa
s how Catholic educators from diverse 
experiential backgrounds negotiate personally persuasive and authoritative 
discourses in fashioning their identities as assistant principals. The inquiry is 
framed by poststructuralist perspect
ives on identity and uses as a methodology a
n
 
ethnographic 
interview 
approach in an effort to understand the transition 
from 
teacher to assistant principal. Interviews with three first
-
year assistant principals 
in two Catholic school districts in a Western
 
Canadian province formed part of 
the data. To obtain the school district

s
 
perspectives, I also interviewed district
-
level personnel who were responsible for leadership formation. Documents from 
the Ministry of Education that included the newly
 
developed 
provincial standards 
for principals as well as documents from the two school districts were also 
analyzed. The research findings reveal that beginning assistant principals 
negotiate their identities as educational leaders when they 
assume 
a role and that 
t
he expectations of the role exist
ed
 
before 
their arrival. These expectations are the 
authoritative discourses that shape the educational leader within the school district 
and that are negotiated with the personally persuasive discourses of the leader. 
The 
tensions that new assistant principals in the study negotiated were conflicting 
discourses of leadership
 
and
 
the dissonance between the challenges and 
affirmations regarding participants

 
deeply held values and the tradi
tional 
institutional demands on admi
nistrators
 
and between 
the 
role expectations and the 
autonomous decision
 
making of leaders. The implications of emphasizing 
questions of identity in leadership development shift 
the 
thinking 
on 
the assistant 
 
 
principal beyond the organizational structure of
 
the role. School districts must 
better attend to the development of the identity of their educational leaders by 
restructuring leadership training programs and ensuring the effectiveness of 
mentoring programs. New assistant principals must themselves addr
ess the 
differences between role and identity and direct attention to the importance of 
developing and strengthening their identities as educational leaders.

CHAPTER 
ONE
:
 
THE QUESTION OF BECOMING AN ASSISTANT PRINCIPAL
 
Research Question
 
In 2002 a pro
jected increase 
in 
principal retirements necessitated 
significant efforts 
in 
my school district to recruit teachers into educational 
administration
,
 
and I was interested. I was curious, however, 
about how 
taking on 
a leadership role 
affects 
a person. Would
 
I be changed in some way in the 
transition to the role of an assistant principal (AP)? What did my and other school 
districts value in terms of the skills necessary to learn to lead, particularly in 
Catholic schools? What might be the school community

s e
xpectations of their 
leaders? In my experience as an educator I encountered 
the 
diverse leadership 
approaches 
of 
individual principals or 
AP
s. 
Their respective approaches often 
varied
 
in the degree of authority 
that they exhibited 
over the staff they manag
ed
 
and as a result of the level of instruction in the scho
ol. As well, no particular 
post
secondary educational background stood out as more gainful in becoming an 
educational leader; an administrator might have studied 
for 
a 
m
aster

s degree in 
curriculum, 
educational psychology, educational administration, religious studies, 
or technology. It seemed that 
these administrators 
both achieved and understood 
leadership 
in very distinctive ways. How then did educational administrators 
make sense of their roles?
 
A
 
Shift 
in 
Identity
 
As I stepped 
back from my own experiences, the question of becoming an 
AP
 
seemed
 
to coalesce around a shift in identity. In Britzman

s
 
(2003)
 
research 
2
 
 
the 
teachers fashion
ed
 
their identities 
by 
negotiating a variety of authoritative and 
personally persuasive discourses. Drawing on 
the work of 
Bakhtin (1981), 
Britzman explained that the shaping of identity is a result of the constant struggle 
between discourses that reflect 

authoritatively sanctioned and conventionally 
taken
-
for
-
granted w
ays of understanding, speaking, and acting

 
(p.
 
39) and 
internally persuasive discourses that 

pull away from norms

 
and admit 

a variety 
of contradictory social discourse

 
(p.
 
43). Bakhtin characterized this struggle 
between authoritative and personally p
ersuasive discourses as 

a sharp gap

 
and 
as a 

d
ialogic relationship

 
that form
s the basi
s for how we become who we are, 
or our 

ideological becoming

 
(p.
 
342).
 
My study built
 
on Britzman

s 
(2003) 
work on teacher identity in which 
she extended Waller

s (1
961; as 
cited 
in Britzman, 2003) question, 

What does 
teaching do to a teacher

 
(p.
 
25) to study the contradictory realities of learning to 
teach. In my own attempt to answer the question 

What 
does 
leading
 
do to a 
leader
?

 
I explore
d
 
how Catholic APs nego
tiate their new identities as educational 
leaders as they move from teaching roles to administrative roles. The qu
estion 
that this study addressed,
 
then
,
 
is 

How do 
Catholic educators from diverse 
experiential backgrounds negotiate personally persuasive an
d authoritative 
discourses in fashioning their identities as 
AP
s?

 
The inquiry 
wa
s framed by poststructu
ralist perspectives on identity
 
that 
we
re anchored in Britzman

s (2003) study of teacher identity and Bracher

s 
(2006) work on foregrounding identity. A
 
posts
tructuralist orientation informed
 
my research quest
ions on leadership and identity, and I examined
 
the underlying 
3
 
 
assumptions and types of discourses from which particular practices originate
,
 
power relations
,
 
and values (
Britzman, 2003; 
Weedon, 1997
).
 
Hall (1996) 
suggested 
that identities are constructed through discourses and that 

we need to 
understand them as produced in specific historical and institutional sites within 
specific discursive formations and practices

 
(p.
 
4). 
He 
also 
pointed out tha
t 
identities 

emerge within the play of specific modalities of power

 
(p.
 
4). 
Bracher

s
 
work on identity and learning helped me to 
understand 
what happens to 
a person

s identity when change and learning occur or are resisted.
 
Ethnographic 
Interview 
Approac
h
 
I use
d
 
an 
ethnographic 
interview 
approach as a method of inquiry in an 
effort to understand the transition 
from 
teacher to 
AP
. My focus 
wa
s on how 
identities are 
negotiated. My question revolved
 
around how individual 
AP
s 
fashion their educational leaders
hip identities in relation to authoritative 
discourses that authorize the practices of leadership and that set out the 
expectations associated with the AP role. I 
explain
 
discursive practices of 
leadership and raise concerns 
about 
why some discourses privi
lege certain 
practices over others. Authoritative discourses, according to Bakhtin (1981)
,
 
bind 
us with their 

power already fused to it

 
(p.
 
342) and are accepted without critical 
examination because they become normalized within a culture and then natura
lly 
reproduced.
 
Using ethnography
 
wa
s an appropriate approach for engaging with the 
researc
h question that this study posed
 
because of my presence in the everyday 
life of 
AP
s; it enabled
 
me to 
better 
understand APs and the school leaders who 
4
 
 
surround them 
as 
their identities
 
are formed.
 
Res
earchers who engage in 
ethnography 
and who use an ethnographic interview as the primary means of data 
collection explore 
the meaning that participants make of their work (Spradley, 
1979). Drawing on the narratives of part
icipant APs, 
I 
anticipated analyzing their 
words to identify the 
discursive practices of leadership 
that shape their identities 
as educational leaders.
 
Because my administrative appointment as a first
-
year AP coincided with 
my doctoral studies, I decided t
hat it would be necessary to adopt the position of 
participant observer to focus on the exploration of my own work and the work of 
others who were in the same position as beginning APs. Within this paradigm I 
sought to develop new understandings of my prof
essional practice 

through 
systematic study .
 
.
 
. of professional action in a particular setting

 
(Trico
glus, 
2001
, p.
 
136). Tricoglus 
reminded us that practitioner research 

has the 
potential 
to build the
 
ability of individuals
 
.
 
.
 
. to engage in critical
 
reflection, challenge 

conventional wisdom,

 
and thereby contribute to the production of knowledge 
about teaching and learning

 
(p.
 
136). To fulfill these requirements, it 
was 
necessary 
that I 
distance myself from the AP role 
to 
more critically examine my
 
own practice
. T
he difficulties of trying to be both a participant and 
an 
observer 
emerge in this process of articulating the story of learning to lead, critiquing its 
practices, and taking into account the voices of
 
other untr
ied APs as well as their 
scho
ol
-
district leaders.
 
I conducted t
his study in two Catholic school districts in a Western 
Canadian province. 
The d
ata collection consisted of the narratives of two 
5
 
 
interviews each with 
three 
beginning 
AP
s in junior high schools within these two 
districts. 
The 
responses to the 
interview questions provided information 
on the 
participants

 
backgrounds, their understanding of leadership and their role, and 
the impact of becoming AP
s
 
on their personal and professional lives. I also 
interviewed district
-
level per
sonnel responsible for leadership formation to obtain 
their perspectives. 
I asked the d
istrict leaders in my study to describe their roles 
within their respective districts, their role in leadership formation and training, 
and t
heir conceptions of leadersh
ip.
 
A third component of 
the 
data collection was the document analysis of 
texts, which comprised the two school districts

 
policies 
on 
the role of the 
AP
 
as 
well as the evaluation criteria for administrators, their annual reports to the 
m
inistry, general i
nformation 
on 
the school districts on their 
Web sites
, 
documents from the Ministry of Education that included the newly
 
developed 
provincial standards for principals, and my research journals.
 
Leadership and Identity: My Own Journey to Leadership
 
My own jo
urney into a leadership position spanned over 20 years as an 
educator. Prior to becoming a teacher in 1983, I studied 
for 
a Bachelor of Arts 
degree in classics and political science, followed by several years 
of 
working as a 
store manager 
in a bookshop. Du
ring this time
 
I volunteered in elementary and 
junior high classrooms and was inspired to enter the Faculty of Secondary 
Education in a university in southern Alberta to pursue a degree 
with a 
specialization 
in French as a second language. I had formerly b
een a student in 
French immersion. After
-
degree education programs at the time often crammed 
6
 
 
all required courses into a 12
-
month span. Ultimately
,
 
I was disappointed in my 
teacher education program
,
 
which offered only one option for subject
-
area 
specializ
ation and overall devoted little time to curriculum and teaching methods. 
The instruction that I received in the French as a second language teaching 
methods class did not easily enable a more generalized application to other 
subject areas. Consequently, t
his made my teaching in core subject areas more 
reliant on teacher guides.
 
Beginning to teach coincided with beginning to parent. Over eight years 
and three children
 
later
, I accepted temporary contract positions at a number of 
different elementary and jun
ior high schools. The variety of subject
-
area 
assignments, responsibilities, and roles proved to be at times exhilarating and 
occasionally deeply discouraging. I accredit part of the impetus for further study 
towards a 
m
aster

s degree to these tumultuous y
ears of part
-
time teaching because 
I felt the need to become much more flexible in understanding a wider scope of 
core curriculum. I completed a 
m
aster

s degree program in secondary education 
with a focus
 
on social studies
,
 
but 
also 
with many courses in En
glish language 
arts. Shortly thereafter, I accepted a full
-
time position as a junior high teacher.
 
From 
Teacher 
to 
Consultant
 
After 
five
 
years of full
-
time teaching, I obtained a position as a curriculum 
consultant with my district and
 
moved more definitiv
ely toward
 
a leadership role 
in teaching and learning. My responsibilities involved primarily supporting 
teachers in the implementation of curriculum as well as staff development, but I 
7
 
 
also participated on district and provincial committees, which broaden
ed
 
my 
understanding of 
the 
protocols and practices employed at both levels.
 
Leadership Formation and Training
 
 
In 2006, after six years in 
a 
consultant role, I enrolled in my school 
district

s leadership formation and training program. The district encoura
ged 

aspiring leaders (teachers seeking a first position in leadership, newly appointed 
assistant principals, department heads, and consultants)

1
 
to take 
its 
Leadership 
Formation and Training Program for a 

reflective look at leadership in a Catholic 
scho
ol environment

 
(p.
 
1
). 
The program consisted of 10 two
-
hour sessions after 
school throughout the year, led by a district principal who worked with the 
Leadership Services Department. The program aimed to focus on 

the essence of 
Catholic Educational leade
rship within the constructs of a school
-
based 
Professional Learning Community

 
(p.
 
2
), 
and the various components of the 
program addressed 

the religious, instructional and managerial aspects of Catholic 
Educational leadership through the lenses of faith a
nd learning, professional 
reading and dialogue, guest presentation, group work/sharing, celebrations, two 
assignments, and journaling

 
(p.
 
2
). 
Successful completion of this program 
potentially qualified 
the 
participants for credit towards a graduate
-
level 
program 
at a local university.

who acted as facilitators. The topics included teacher leadership, the 
institutionalization of professional learning communities as part o
f a school

s 
culture, and 
the 
strengthening 
of 
the understanding of a Catholic identity. Groups 
of participants explored a perspective on leadership from Stephen Covey

s 
business world and read articles from educational writers on diverse topics such 
as pr
ofessional learning communities (DuFour, Eaker, & DuFour, 2005), school 
culture (Deal & Peterson, 1999; Sergiovanni, 2000), emotional intelligence 
(Goleman, Boyatzis, & McKee, 2002)
,
 
and te
acher leadership (Lambert, 1998,
 
2003).
 
The principle underlying mo
st of the readings reinforce
d
 
the importance of 
establishing professional learning communities as a means of improving teaching 
and learning and fostering better staff relationships
. Several years ago my district 
mandated professional learning communities 
in all schools 
to 
facilitate 
collaborative practice, which 
is 
understood to be an integral component of a 
shared leadership approach. Other themes that emerged from the program were 
the importance of developing personal relationships with staff, an emphasi
s on 
adaptability and change regarding school culture, and understandings of teacher 
leadership.
 
Entering Educational Leadership
 
 
It was curious to me how quickly my immersion into the world of 
educational administration took place. As part of 
its 
staffing
 
cycle, my district 
announced administrative positions in March, six full months before the start of 
9
 
 
the next school year. In March 2007 one of my district

s senior administrators 
contacted me to inform me
 
that I had been assigned as an 
AP
 
in 
an elementary
/
junior high school. I was familiar with the school

s location, a middle
-
to
-
high 
socioeconomic neighbourhood, 
populated 
predominantly by families of white
-
collar professionals. The school served 630 students from kindergarten to 
Grade
 
9
 
and had
 
over 
50 
tea
chers, support staff, and teaching assistants. Because of the 
school

s size, two APs support the principal;
 
my 
co
-
AP
 
came to the school that
 
same year
,
 
but with four years 
of 
experience in the AP role.
 
 
My relationship with the school began soon after the 
senior 
administrator

s call because 
the principal 
invited 
me 
to participate in many of the 
school

s organizational activities to set up practices for the following year. 
Although my principal explained that APs new to a school were under no 
obligation to i
nvolve themselves in the school

s operation at this time, I 
saw 
this 
as an opportunity to begin 
to shape
 
my administrative role
,
 
and I gladly accepted. 
Before the end of June the three of us had accomplished several tasks germane to 
the 
beginning 
of 
the fo
llowing school year. Although I had little interaction with 
students during those spring months, I began to develop relationships with staff.
 
Reflecting on My First Year as an Assistant Principal
 
My transition into an 
AP
 
role during August and September, a
lthough 
eased by the advice and presence of my principal and 
co
-
AP
, nevertheless 
occurred 
at a
n
 
accelerated pace. 
Hartzell
, Williams, and Nelson
 
(1995) posited 
that first
-
year APs usually do not 
assume 
their role fully understanding what 
it 
involves
 
and th
at shock and surprise typically characterize the first weeks. They 
10
 
 
noted that first
-
year AP can 
perceive change
 
as 
either 
distressing and trying or 
energizing and capacity
 
building. My first two months as an AP were not 
exceptions to this dynamic.
 
When I a
rrived at my new school, I anticipated be
com
ing a full 
administrative participant. In previous university course work I had read many 
books and articles that positioned leadership as dis
tributed, shared, and inclusive;
 
and this model seemed practical to a 
first
-
year AP 
who was 
eager to become a 
partner immersed in educational administration. The extent to which power and 
administrative tasks are shared
,
 
however, is the principal

s decision
 
and is based 
upon 
his or her 
prior experiences and understandings of
 
leadership. A principal in 
my district can act with great autonomy within his or her school; however, this 
more traditional autonomous approach to school administration is slowly being 
replaced by a more collaborative and relational model. The decisions i
n my 
school were often shared through discussion within a loosely hierarchical 
administrative structure. For a new AP, there was 
a 
great benefit to this 
inclusionary approach because it gave me 
an 
opportunity to talk through the 
situations I encountered an
d eventually to gain more confidence in using my own 
judgment.
 
In the research journal that I kept throughout my first year as an AP, I 
wrote very little about the positive outcomes that I experienced and much more 
about the times when the job generated an
gst. I recalled feeling excited and open 
to something new as well as uncertain about my abilities. Although I relished 
learning to solve problems related to an unusual growth in school population, I 
11
 
 
struggled with issues of staff performance
 
such as 
a teac
her

s habitual tardiness in 
arriving at school, as well as with problems related to student discipline. 
On 
several occasions teachers expected expedience in 
meting out 
consequence
s
 
for 
misbehaving student
s
,
 
and often with little desire 
for 
discussion. I fe
ared being 
perceived as weak and indecisive if I did not take quick action, but I was also 
hesitant 
about being 
perceived as unfair as a result of not 
having fully investigated
 
the
 
situation. These events tested my relationships with teachers and students 
and 
compelled an ongoing examination of my resolve and my values. I was struggling 
to make sense of this new role.
 
Significance of the Study
 
The role of the 
AP
 
has not shifted noticeably in the past 30 years in spite 
of its importance to leadership in scho
ols. Most research on 
AP
s focuses on the 
bureaucratic organization of the AP role (
Armstrong, 2005; Marshall & Hooley, 
2006; Matthews & Crow, 2003; Retelle, 2003; 
Weller & Weller, 2002), on 
recruitment (
Armstrong, 2005; English, 2008; 
Hartzell
 
et
 
al
., 
1995
; Marshall & 
Hooley, 2006)
,
 
and strategies for improvement (
Armstrong, 2005; Hatt, 2005; 
Marshall & Hooley, 2006; 
Matthews & Crow, 2003; Retelle, 2003
; Weller & 
Weller, 2002
). This inquiry 
into 
how educators negotiate personally persuasive 
and authoritativ
e discourses in fashioning their identities as 
AP
s is situated in 
existing research on the 
AP
 
and educational leadership. Few studies, however,
 
link
ed
 
identity formation and the 
AP
 
role (Hartzell, Williams, & Nelson, 1994; 
McWilliam, 2000), and even less r
esearch 
has addressed
 
the discourses that 
authorize what contemporary leadership looks like 
in 
an educational setting 
12
 
 
(Allan, Gordon, & Iverson, 2006). 
In t
his study
,
 
in an attempt to reveal the 
authoritative discourses of leadership that have shaped three
 
new APs, 
I 
ex
plored
 
the
ir
 
perspectives as they construct
ed
 
their identities as educational leaders.
 
Structure of the Thesis
 
Chapter one has introduced the research question through the lens of my 
own journey to
ward
 
leadership. My question focuses on how b
eginning 
AP
s from 
diverse experiential backgrounds fashion their educational leadership identities in 
relation to personally persuasive and authoritative discourses.
 
Chapter 
two review
s
 
the literature on 
AP
s and educational leadership with 
a particular foc
us on the identity formation of 
AP
s. In this respect, I examine 
poststructural perspectives on identity
 
formation and discuss how they
 
help to 
understand
 
the formation of educational leaders.
 
Chapter three describes 
my 
approach to this study
 
using an ethno
graphic 
interview
. The chapter discusses the research design, data collection, ethical 
considerations, and the limitations of the study. 
Because 
the study begins 
autobiographically, I make my positioning as a researcher explicit.
 
Chapters four and five pre
sent an account and my interpretation of 
conversations with three beginning AP participants and an examination of the 
perspectives of two school districts based on interviews with a district leader from 
each district and district documents. Chapter four di
scusses Mission Catholic 
School District
 
(MCSD)
, which is a medium
-
sized rural district in a 
Western 
Canadian province that serves over 6
,
700 students in 
18 
schools. Chapter five 
focuses on Trinity Catholic School District
 
(TCSD)
, an urban Catholic school 
13
 
 
district in a medium
-
sized city in a 
Western 
Canadian province, with 
80 
schools 
and over 35,000 students.
 
Chapter six 
discusses 
how 
each of the school districts in my study took up 
particular discursive practices of leadership 
that 
the three 
AP
 
participant
s and 
their district leaders
 
enacted
. I discuss the impact of diverse understandings of 
leadership 
on 
school districts and AP identities, the values 
that the 
participants 
hold 
that 
contradict 
the traditional institutional demands of administration, and the
 
tension for the three 
AP
s 
over 
compliance 
with 
au
thority and autonomous 
decision 
making.
 
Chapter seven presents my conclusions about the conflicting discourses 
that circulate
 
within the two districts and their schools and the importance of 
appreciating th
at neophyte educational leaders, like teachers, must negotiate their 
identities.

CHAPTER TWO:
 
LITERATURE REVIEW ON THE ROLE AND IDENTITIES
 
OF ASSISTANT PRINCIPALS
 
 
To investigate how Catholic educators from diverse experiential 
backgrounds negotiate perso
nally persuasive and authoritative discourses of 
leadership, I 
will 
(a)
 
review the literature on the history of the 
AP
 
role
, 
(b)
 
examine
 
t
he relationship between 
the 
AP role and identity formation through 
the lens of two books that represent mainstream lit
erature on new AP leadership, 
and 
(c)
 
present an 
overview of the literature on diverse understandings of 
educational leadership. The questions of identity in the study are framed by 
poststructuralist theory 
on 
authoritative discourses of leadership that sh
ape 
educational leadership practice. These authoritative discourses are discerned in 
relationships of power within schools and school districts, neoliberal influences 
that impact educational practices, and discourses of Catholic educational 
leadership.
 
Ass
istant Principal Role and Educational Leadership Origin
 
of the Assistant Principal Role
 
According to Glanz (1994), the AP role likely emerged 
from the roles of 
two teacher 
supervisors.
 
During the 1920s teachers in larger schools were selected 
and designate
d to be 
special
 
supervisors to help l
ess
-
experienced teachers in a 
subject area. These teachers, usually female, were selected to be APs but 
had 
no 
independent authority, nor did they evaluate colleagues. There was also a 
general 
supervisor, who was usuall
y male
,
 
had 
more authority than the special 
15
 
 
supervisors
, and
 
assisted the principal in the logistical operations of the school. 
He was considered the primary assistant. The special supervisory role disappeared 
in the 1930s, and in the 1940s and 1950s the t
itle 
assistant principal
 
began to 
appear in the literature.
 
Kelly (1987) explained that APs took on more administrative 
responsibility in schools because of increasing demands on the principal

s time. 
Matthews and Crow (2003) noted that, over time, factors
 
such as the changing 
social demographics of cities and schools and the creation of larger school 
districts have influenced the principal

s role. Secondary principals began to teach 
less
,
 
and in inner cities administrative assistants were needed to deal wi
th poverty 
issues and the larger number of students. Eventually, hiring APs also freed 
principals for instructional leadership tasks. Marshall and Hooley (2006) reported 
that the position of the assistant did not actually arise from any 

clear and 
thoughtf
ul planning

 
(p.
 
2) in terms of what assistants might accomplish, but 
simply evolved as a supporting role to the principal. In the 1970s
,
 
Matthews and 
Crow pointed out, the AP role gained more significance with respect to the 
operation of the school. They 
noted references to the assistant as 

subordinate to

 
or 

parallel with the principal

 
or as a 

specialist

 
and even a 

henchman

 
(p.
 
20). 
Today, according to these writers, the principal and AP roles 
can 
function in a 
parallel fashion, but do not in all c
ases.
 
The Changing Role of the Assistant Principal
 
The multitudinous duties and tasks assigned to the AP are somewhat 
overwhelming and at times surprisingly dissimilar between schools (Hartzell
 
16
 
 
et
 
al
.
, 1995). Marshall and Hooley (2006) affirmed that APs of
ten act as 
disciplinarians
,
 
but they also deal with social
-
justice issues such as immigration 
and poverty. APs are also expected to maintain the norms and rules of the school, 
play a role as mediators, maintain order in an institutional setting, and manage
 
the 
many issues that children bring to the school.
 
Apart from school management, APs

 
responsibilities during the day are 
numerous. Issues of community relations, curriculum and instruction, special 
education programming, and personnel are key components 
of the range of tasks. 
Hartzell 
et
 
al
.
 
(1995) noted that in a v
ery short time, first
-
year APs
 
had to alter their long
-
held perspective on schools, enter a new peer group, 
redefine relationships with former colleagues, and establish working 
associations wit
h a new group of subordinates, while taking on unfamiliar, 
multiple, rapidly paced, and sometimes highly emotional tasks
. 
(p.
 
125)
 
Weller and Weller (2002) suggested that
,
 
to be successful in this job, the 
AP should be able to work with teams and understan
d how to improve instruction 
and implement curriculum. In a survey of APs in 2000, Weller and Weller found 
that 25% of the participants lacked the necessary leadership skills for some of 
these tasks. They also observed that the APs felt that they were 
the 
most 
inadequately prepared 
to motivate teachers, develop
 
curriculum
 
for the 

real 
world,

 
resolve conflict, work
 
e
ffectively in teams, and deal
 
with the politics of 
the job.
 
Assistant principals learn to comply with the dominant values 
of 
their 
school dist
rict
s
, according to Marshall and Hooley (2006); however
,
 
in instances 
of conflict they tend to rely on their own value systems to make decisions. The 
authors explained that APs put aside policies in favour of fairness, caring, and 
17
 
 
openness. In their examin
ation of the unstated rules or discourses on educational 
leadership, Marshall and Hooley observed that APs eventually come to 
understand the 

limits on their roles and their expression of value

 
(p.
 
55); they 
learn to curb their risk
-
taking behaviours, and
 
when the need arises, they remake 
policy quietly and discreetly, bending the rules as necessary to help students.
 
The 
AP is well advised by the
 
district to demonstrate commitment, keep disputes 
private when they arise, know school and district policies th
oroughly, and avoid 
being labelled a troublemaker (Daresh, 2001; Marshall 
& 
Hooley, 2006).
 
Appeal and Challenges of the Assistant Principal Role
 
Although Marshall and Hooley (2006) reported that many teachers are 
highly motivated to apply for school
-
based 
administrative position
s
, some 
perceive the 
AP
 
role as too challenging. In their study Marshall and Hooley found 
that teachers who consider the assistant principalship a desirable career also 
believe that they are qualified and 
that others encourage them 
t
o take risks. They 
maintained that, following their entrance into educational administration, new 
APs transform themselves from teachers into administrators through an 

anticipatory socialization

 
(p.
 
36) process. Marshall and Hooley explained that
,
 
during
 
this process, interested teachers develop or enhance favourable attitudes 
towards educational leadership and separate themselves from other teachers; they 
find ways to demonstrate their own leadership abilities. According to Marshall 
and Hooley, teachers 
interested in educational administration often learn from the 
role modeling of their principals
,
 
or they take on supplementary responsibilities as 
department heads and participate on committees or 
in 
special projects, all as part 
18
 
 
of 
the 
acquisition of
 
admi
nistrative skills. Hartzell 
et
 
al
. (1995) contended, 
however, that many of the tasks associated with running a school are invisible to 
teachers. These tasks are often hidden or completed behind the scenes to ensure a 
smooth flow within the school and to im
pede interruptions to teaching and 
learning. Consequently, teachers are not always aware of the scope of an 
administrative position and may be surprised when they become APs.
 
Marshall and Hooley (2006) identified several reasons for not applying for 
the jo
b of AP. They cited Wynn

s (2003) study of female teachers with leadership 
potential 
who 
perceived the extra stresses that assistants experience as a deterrent 
to 
seeking 
the position; some of the barriers are distantiation from children in the 
classroom
,
 
the need to relinquish teaching time
,
 
encounters with principals who 
favour hierarchical control and subvert the efforts of APs, 
and 
the time in the role 
that is 
consumed by 
managerial tasks 
rather than 
instruc
tional leadership. 
Marshall and Hooley 
also 
ci
ted teachers

 
feelings of ambiguity with respect to the 
mediation of students

 
identities and values 
and 
fear of retribution in disciplining 
s
tudents 
as possible deterrents.
 
Another challenge 
that 
Marshall and Hooley (2006) 
noted 
was that 
recruitment and s
election procedures typically favour candidates who conform to 
the traditions and normative practices of the school. They added that there may be 
little room for 
creative
 
educational leadership because recruitment practices 
support conformist work requirem
ents. Blackmore, Thomson, and Barty (2006) 
asserted that the co
nservative practice
 
of hiring committees give
s
 
rise to 
homostability
, a term 
that 
they use
d
 
to describe the extent to which these types of 
19
 
 
committees 
hire
 
people like themselves. This approach,
 
they contended, results in 
little risk and little consideration for alternatives; people outside the conservative 
role who challenge existing practice and have conflicting feelings about 
educational administration and incumbent administrators are less lik
ely to be 
hired. Marshall and Hooley pointed out that such candidates may be perceived as 

less trustworthy

 
and 

not loyal enough

 
(p.
 
14) to be
come
 
administrators.
 
Assistant Principal Role and Identity
 
Much of the 
existing research on APs focused
 
on the 
bureaucra
tic 
organization of the AP role
 
rather than on how the role relates to identity; thus, 
the literature is replete with issues of recruitment, the nature of the AP role, 
socialization into the role, 
the 
demands of the job, 
the 
benefits of mentoring,
 
and 
strategies for success (
Hartzell 
et
 
al
., 1994; 
Marshall & Hooley, 2006; Matthews 
& Crow, 2003; Weller & Weller, 2002). Although these areas may relate to the 
outward experience of the AP, they do not take into account AP subjectivities and 
the ways in
 
which beginning AP
s negotiate
 
identity, and they do not discuss the 
discursive practices of leadership that shape these identities.
 
The change of roles and the transition from being a teacher to taking on 
the 
additional ex
pectations of leadership imp
l
y
 
th
e negotiation of new identities. 
The change involve
s not
 
only 
what new AP
s
 
do within the role, but also who they 
are and what it means to be an educational leader. Carson (2005) remarked in the 
context of curriculum change that change involves 

a conversat
ion between the 
self (identity) and new sets of circumstances that are external to the self

 
(p.
 
3). 
APs

 
s
ubjectivities have already been deeply formed by their personal histories 
20
 
 
and are now confronted by a set of new relationships and different perspect
ives 
that are shaped by conceptions of leadership, the school community, teachers
,
 
and 
students.
 
Construction of the Leadership Role
 
This study investigated
 
how 
new APs assume an 
educational leadership 
role. English (2008) suggested that educational leader
ship is like a performance 
that 

involves a role and that [the] role is learned, meaning acquired

 
(p.
 
121). He 
maintained that the role of a school administrator is culturally defined and that it 
fits into a larger social order embedded in a bureaucratic 
structure
 
that 
legitimize
s, 
not
 
the authority of the leader, but the authority of the 
office
 
of the leader. 
According to English, the role has 

its own constructions, pretensions, 
mythologies, conceits, perceptions, and lies

 
(p.
 
121)
,
 
and the expectations
 
of the 
role determine the way that leadership 
plays
 
out for an individual.
 
To emphasize his point that educational leadership is like a performance, 
English (2008) drew a comparison between an actor playing a role and an 
educational leader doing the same.
 
Both recognize the social construction of the 
scene or context (for example, a school embedded in a larger environment). 
Actors and administrators are simultaneously outsiders 
who are 
watching events 
unfold and insiders 
who are 
interacting with other play
ers. All of the players and 
actors, according to English, 
have 
the ability to peer inward and reflect on how 
they feel about the story 
that is 
unfolding. This theatre analogy 
created 
an image 
for me of a new 
AP
 
playing a role within a particular context 
th
at 
is socially 
constructed. The analogy also opened up a space to delineate the often hidden 
21
 
 
aspect of identity formation. The identity of an AP is indeed impacted by the role 
based on the choices and negotiations 
that 
he or she makes to consent to or resi
st 
the existing discursive practices in the 

scene

 
(p.
 
124) or within the expectations 
of the community.
 
The Relationship Between Identity and the Administrative Role
 
When a person takes on the role of an educational leader, questions of 
identity do not s
eem explicit in the everyday world of school, nor are they easily 
found in the existing body of research on APs. To further explore this relationship 
between identity and the administrative role, I selected two books from 
the 
mainstream literature on leade
rship that I believe reflect the type of information 
on 
educational leadership that is 
the 
most familiar to me and to my administrative 
colleagues and that might typically influence training programs for new 
AP

s (1995)

Field

Work Lives

-
Year Assistant Principals
. Both 
of these texts focus on the complexity of educational leader
ship roles and tasks as 
well as on accounts of the socialization process that is essential for new 
AP
s 
to 
successfully 
assume 
the role. Although 
there are implications for identity 
formation, there is no explicit mention of how AP identities are shaped or 
of the 
discourses that shape them.
 
In 
their 
reconceptualization of the educational leadership role, 
Matthews 
and Crow (2003) pay 
no overt attention to identity. The discursive practices of 
leadership that shape the role of the school administrator, they cl
aimed, are rife 
22
 
 
with misconceptions about what it means to lead
,
 
and 
they 
therefore contribute to 
problems 
with 
how the administrative role might be enacted. The prevailing 
misconceptions of leadership 
that 
they described suggest that leadership is a 
conce
pt 
that is 
interchangeable with management
,
 
that leadership resides 
primarily in only one person
,
 
and that the leader is assumed to be born to the role. 
Conversely, 
Matthews and Crow 
emphasized that leadership can be more 
accurately understood as an influe
nce relationship between leaders and followers, 
that it reflects learned behavio
u
r, and that it encompasses many more complex 
tasks than 
those 
of a manager 
and 
include
s
 
such constructs as learner, leader, 
mentor, supervisor, politician, and advocate. For M
atthews and Crow, the 
reconceptualization of the principal role is therefore commensurate with 
society

s 
continual reshaping of authoritative discourses, 
which have most recently 
reflected
 
a push for standards
-
based reform and more public scrutiny. As well
, 
other areas influenced 
this reshaping of leadership, such as shifting demographics 
and technology advances, all of which require an approach to leadership that 
emanates from more than just the person at the top. The nature of the 
administrative role is t
herefore in an evolutionary state as a result of the 
continually shifting understandings of leadership.
 
Rather than 
emphasize
 
questions of identity, M
atthews and Crow (2003) 
identified and classified
 
the tasks, responsibilities, and duties associated with 
the 
administrative role, as well as ways in which new AP
s
 
might best manage 
their 
complex position. In their book
 
they did
 
not use the word 
identity
; it is not in the 
index
,
 
nor is it a heading or subheading in the body of the book. 
They mention t
he 
23
 
 
word 
s
elf
-
awareness
 
within the context of current research on the importance of 
emotional intelligence and 
the need to be 
aware of how to manage one

s own 
emotions. 
However
, 
Matthews and Crow acknowledged 
the importance of what 
individual
s bring
 
to the administr
ative role and how the existing skills of the 
educator will impact practice (which is related to identity formation). New 
principals, they argue
d
, can either make the role their own in ways 

not 
previously expected

 
(p.
 
3) or accept the role as it has been
 
established within the 
context of the school. In other words, they can assert their own ideas of leadership 
when 
they take 
on the role
,
 
or they can fit in with established administrative 
practices.
 
Although Matthews and Crow (2003) asserted that the role 
of the 
AP
 
functions in a parallel fashion to the 
role of the 
principal, beginning APs are more 
apt to take on already established roles because they lack the requisite experience 
and confidence 
to understand
 
the tasks involved in their role. The authors al
so 
stressed the 
need 
for new APs to discover the school

s values, 

which may be 
contradictory to 
their
 
previous teaching or internship ex
periences

 
(p.
 
274), but 
they did
 
not discuss how new APs reconcile contradictory values 
with 
their own 
beliefs, experi
ences, and values. The implications of Matthews and Crow

s 
understanding of leadership is that the educational administrator is expected to 
cooperate and comply with accepted practices in a school community to be 
effective in the role of 
AP
. The omission o
f any discussion on identity formation 
obfuscates the internal struggle 
that 
new AP
s
 
face 
in developing their sense of 
themselves as 
including 
the identity of an AP.

s (1995) 
second commonly used book, 
New 
Voices 
in the 
Field
: The 
Work Live
s 
of 
First
-
Year Assistant Principals
, 
is based on a five
-
year 
study on the everyday realities 
that 
new APs 
face 
in secondary schools in the 
United States. They focused on the socialization process that prepares beginning 
APs for an administrative role and 
on what 
the experience of being an AP 
feels 
like to offer educators a preview of what awaits APs in the office. 
Hartzell 
et
 
al
.

s 
intention was to describe first
-
year AP experiences in 

human terms

 
(p.
 
ix) that 
give
 
voice to the insights of new APs in a m
ore personal way. Hartzell 
et
 
al
. drew 
on stories from beginning secondary APs about their professional and personal 
experiences in the transition from teacher to administrator and the adjustments 
that 
they had to make. 
They 
revealed that
,
 
upon 
beginning t
he role, APs lack
 
an 
understanding 
of 
the nature of the role and the skills that are deemed essential to 
performing the role effectively.
 
 
With respect to the identity formation of new APs, Hartzell 
et
 
al
. 
(1995) 
observed that the new administrative role 
h
as caused 
professional and personal 
changes in AP
s
. However, 
they did not overtly suggest 
the development of 
identity as a significant factor in preparing AP
s
 
for the role of principal. Rather, 
the authors emphasized the constants in the role
 
such as 
stude
nt discipline and 
attendance, 
th
e
 
different 
measures of time and duty 
from those 
in the classroom, 
the redefinition of 
relationships with former colleagues, 
the 
manage
ment of
 
new 
relationships with school staff, and the emotional impact of becoming an AP a
s a 
result of unexpected experiences. Although the socialization of educators into the 
complex role of an educational leader impacts their future 
behaviour
, Hartzell 
25
 
 
et
 
al
. described them as being formed, not as AP identities, but
 
as more effective 
workers
. The question of identity in their book, however, is evident in their 
discussion of how the ret
elling of experiences threatens or reinforces
 
th
e self
-
image of new APs and their 
subsequent appreciation of their participants

 
willingness to be vulnerable an
d set aside ego 
to reveal
 
the depth of their 
experiences. Although 
the used 
the word 
identity
 
only within the context of 
discipline
,
 
for example, 
as 
in 

so deeply ingrained in AP identity

 
(p.
 
46
), they 
also imply it
 
in the 

psychic costs to the AP

 
(p.
 
46
) when support from other 
administrators is lacking.
 
Hartzell 
et
 
al
.

s (1995) entire study is an examination of the personal 
experiences of the AP, but not explicitly about AP identity and identity formation 
in spite of its format 
in which they relate
 
the 
narratives of 
their 
participants. It 
seem
s
 
that the point of relating narratives 
on 
becoming an AP is to show how 
the 
experience affects the life story of 
the 
participants
;
 
for example
,
 
by exploring 
what learning to lead 
does 
to new AP
s
 
as 
they negotiate
 
t
heir new administrative 
role. The study is, at best, a description of how a discourse of socialization 
operates to assist first
-
year AP
s
 
in their transiti
on to educational administrators
 
and 
the 
strategies 
that 
benefit initiates as they deal with the many 
challenges and 
demands of the job.
 
In these texts and in other mainstream leadership literature, there is little 
discussion of what the conflicts and contradictions inherent in the AP role mean to 
the developing identity of an AP. There is 
also 
little refe
rence to the authoritative 
discourses of leadership that shape
s
 
administrative practice and the identity of an 
26
 
 
AP. Absent is a conversation about AP identity as a thing negotiated or as 
something that matters to the enactment of the role. Possibly, this la
ck of attention 
to identity implies that AP identity is, on the surface, of no real outward concern 
or consequence to a school district or to a body of research because it is 
essentially the AP

s job to fit the role when he or she fills it. In other words,
 
becoming an AP is less about the impact of the administrative 
fit
 
on the self and 
identity and more about the visible, technical, and procedural aspects 
of 
gradual 
socialization into the role. I argue, however, that the question of identity merits 
much mo
re attention, both in research on educational leadership 
and 
within the 
actual place of school.
 
Perspectives on Educational Leadership
 
The perspectives 
on 
leadership in the literature both inform and confuse 
the reader

s understanding of how leadership is 
enacted. The concept of leader 
has 
a long history and many interpretations of what constitutes good leadership 
within contexts that are quite dissimilar. The nature of leadership as well, from an 
educational perspective, challenges the new administrator to
 
make sense of the 
various subject positions that a leader may
 
assume
.
 
Conceptions of Educational Leadership
 
Pairing 
the words 
educational
 
and 
leadership
 
creates 
an interesting 
redundancy 
with regard to 
their interpretation. To lead and to educate share 
si
milar etymologies, according to the Oxford English Dictionary Online. 
Lead
 
has 
origins in both German (
leaden
) and Latin (
ducere
) and means
,
 
literally
,
 

to go 
with a load

 
(Oxford English Dictionary Online, 2010b, 
Par. 1
), 
which suggests
 
27
 
 
that as you journe
y, you carry something weighty or perhaps of importance. 
Educate
 
is from the Latin 
educere
 
and 
means 

to lead out

 
(Oxford English 
Dictionary Online, 2010
a
, 
Par. 1
). An educator
,
 
then
,
 
is a leader who makes 
known or brings forth that which is important. Bu
t what is important, to whom
 
is 
it important
, under what circumstances
 
is it important
, and who decides? In his 
exploration of the origin and history of leadership, Burns (1978) contended that 
people

s diverse conceptions of leadership lead to ambiguous an
d confusing 
understandings. In other words, our shared understanding of what leadership is, is 
not shared at all. Th
is literature review continues the
 
struggle to encapsulate so 
complex a concept.
 
English (1994) pointed out that connotations of leadership 
stem from 
narratives 
on 
the great dee
ds of ancient male Greek heroes and that
 
a leader

s 
quick action, creativity, powers of observation, and sense of the theatrical 
continue to characterize certain leaders today. Burns (1978) drew on his own 
study of grea
t men in history to suggest a distinction between two types of 
leadership: transactional, which depicts leadership as an exchange relationship 
between leaders and followers, and transformational, which is characterized as 
causative, morally purposeful, ele
vated, and a collective endeavour. He posited 
that what counts as leadership should serve to improve humankind, to lead 
upwards, 
and 
to make better citizens and 
should 
not be a personally self
-
serving 
act. Otherwise, leadership should be considered 
as 
powe
r
 
wielding or tyranny.
 
Building on Burns

 
(1978) 
conception of leadership, other researchers 
attempted to clarify its nature and broaden its scope. 
Foster
 
(1989) asserted that 
28
 
 
leadership has a dialectical character, which implies that leadership and 
follow
ership cannot occur without each other. He observed that leadership and 
followership are often exchangeable and entwined in a series of mutual 
negotiations within a social community and are, therefore, both context bound. He 
contended that leadership is th
erefore not simply a matter of focusing on the 
individual qualities or personality traits of a leader. This focus on the leader or on 
the leader

s personality minimizes the importance of the role 
of 
followers or of 
the leader

s
 
situation 
and suggests that 
a leader with 

a certain set of traits is 
crucial to having effective leadership

 
(Germain, 2008
, p.
 
2). English (2008) 
proposed that 
the popular media obscure 
the nature of leadership by 
creating
 

the 
illusion that leaders are special people who have [fro
m birth] traits, habits, 
behaviors, or supernatural qualities

 
(p.
 
121).
 
Burns (1978) also pointed out the important influences of such diverse 
people as Niccolo Machiavelli and Dale Carnegie in constructing a definition of 
leadership, the former for his a
dvice on coercion and inhuman manipulation of 
others and the latter for his strategies 

to arouse in the person an eager want and 
then to satisfy it

 
(p.
 
447), both attempts to persuade others to do something that 
the influencer wants them to d
o. Leithwood
 
and Duke (1999) dre
w on Yukl

s 
(1994) study 
to suggest
 
that leadership
 
as a social
-
influence process involves a 
leader or group 
who exert
 
influence over others or over a group to structure the 
activities and relationships. Yukl (2002) added that this proc
ess occurs with much 
variety in terms of who exerts influence and how much. Rost (1991) also 
29
 
 
described leadership as an influence relationship
 
and distinguished
 
between direct 
influence and the facilitating of others

 
influence.
 
The concept of leadership a
s heroic or as residing in a person with the 
right traits continues to be attractive and contested, according to English (1994). 
He maintained that the work of an effective educational leader day to day is far 
from daring and gallant; on the contrary, he s
uggested that it is quite unheroic in 
the Homeric tradition. English (2008) emphasized that leadership is a fabricated 
social construction and not a 

genetic capacity

 
(p.
 
120). Leadership is more the 
product of human interactions and negotiations than of 
any great individual

s 
stepping forward (
Foster
, 1989).
 
Models of Educational Leadership
 
In an attempt to develop a relational conception of educational leadership, 
Leithwood and Duke (1999) categorized models of contemporary leadership 
practice based on a
n analysis of the educational leadership literature over a 
10
-
year span; 
they described 
these models as transformational, instructional, 
moral, participative, managerial, and contingent. They opened up questions 
about 
the similarities and differences among
st leadership categories in terms of key 
relationships and influence. Other models of leadership are variously described as 
shared (Lambert, 2002), distributed (
Hatcher, 2005; 
Spillane, 
200
6
),
 
and inclusive 
(
Ryan, 2006).
 
I 
will 
frame this particular discus
sion of leadership with three of 
Leithwood and Duke

s models of leadership because they are 
the 
most germane to 
this study; the categories are 
(a)
 
transformational leadership which, as 
I 
30
 
 
mentioned previously, has its genesis in 
the 
work 
of 
Burns (1978); 
(b
)
 
moral 
leadership; 
and 
(c)
 
managerial leadership.
 
Transformational leadership.
 
There are varying interpretations of 
transformational leadership, according to Leithwood and Duke (1999). They 
pointed out that the focus of transformational leadership ranges 
from the 

transcendence of self
-
interest by both leader and led

 
to higher levels of 
commitment and 

capacities of organizational members to result in greater 
productivity

 
(p.
 
49). 
Foster
 
(1989) noted that a transformational leadership 
approach involves t
he cultivation of small social changes that make a difference 
to a group
 
and that occasionally generate
 
a complete restructuring of society. It 
expands the basis for leadership because it is a practice centered not on the self, 
but on others, and it is ori
ented towards the transformation of social relations both 
incrementally and significantly. Larger, more significant structural changes that 
arise from transformational leadership models are evident in areas such as the 
critical examination of feminism and 
racial awareness (Capper, 2003; Laible, 
2003; Méndez
-
Morse, 2003).
 
Hallinger (1992) posited that the transformational leader emerged in the 
1990s as a result of the introduction of site
-
based management and the subsequent 
inclusion of teachers and parents 
in the decision
-
making process. He asserted that 
teachers, as acknowledged sources of expertise, now had opportunities to 
implement their own ideas to improve schooling; in other words, the school itself 
became the initiator of change. Teachers could assis
t in problem finding based on 
information that they gather
ed
 
on student achievement at the school site, and then 
31
 
 
problem
-
solve. Principals became the leaders of teacher leaders; their task was to 
develop their teachers

 
instructional leadership skills as w
ell as to work with them 
o
n collaborative endeavours (
Blase, 2004; 
Blase & Kirby, 2000; 
Glanz, 2006; 
Marzano, 2003
; Schmoker, 2002
). Hallinger contended that this process of 
leading was no longer a discretionary and private act by a single leader, but open
 
to public scrutiny.
 
Moral leadership. 
Leithwood and Duke (1999) averred that another model 
of educational leadership, moral leadership, presented a variety of different 
understandings as well. 
Some 
moral leadership approaches focus on the leader

s 
values 
and ethics, 
whereas 
others consider the 

nature of values and how conflicts 
among values can be resolved

 
(p.
 
50). English (1994) asserted that a standard for 
determining moral leadership is a record of 
people

s 
actions

their habits and 
character

and some 
concept of their most private thoughts to 

grasp 
[their]
 
intent or purpose

 
(p.
 
167). According to 
Foster
 
(1989), a moral leader carries a 
responsibility to be a cause of civic moral education and not just to be 

personally 
moral

 
(p.
 
56). He suggested tha
t the ethical commitment of leadership, based on 
moral relationships, is geared toward the democratic values of a community and 
underpins a communal search for the good life.
 
Sergiovanni (2000) maintained that moral leadership provides a leader 
with the so
urces of authority necessary for effective leadership practice because it 
emphasizes the bringing together in a school community of diverse people, a 
shared vision, and common ideals with a common cause. Matthews and Crow 
(2003) regarded moral and ethical 
leadership as grounded in early connections 
32
 
 
between principals and the ministry. The principal

s work was perceived as 
having great spiritual importance; being religious, they pointed out, was an early 
criterion for principal recruitment and selection. Acc
ording to them, public 
schools have now pushed away the discursive threads linked to religion, but 
within Catholic systems (and other schools 
cent
e
red on 
a particular faith), 
participation in the church community and an outward display of Christian values 
continues to keep dynamic the conversations about morality.
 
Moral leadership may also be approached as an investigation into the 
relationships between various stakeholders as well as the distribution of power 
within an organization (Leithwood & Duke, 1999)
.
 
Managerial leadership.
 
A model of leadership that draws attention to the 
relationship between leadership in education and leadership in business 
management is managerial leadership. In Leithwood and Duke

s
 
(1999)
 
research
, 
managerial leadership focuses o
n 

the functions, tasks, or behaviours of the 
leader

 
and presupposes that, if these tasks are competently carried out, 

the work 
of others in the organization will be facilitated

 
(p.
 
53). They indicated that much 
of the literature in their analysis treat
ed management and leadership as distinct 
and competing concepts. To emphasize these distinctions and comparisons in 
terms of task type, they identified the major tasks of management as 
implementing 
policy, maintaining organizational stability, and 

ensurin
g that 
routine organizational tasks are 

done right
,

 
whereas 
they described 
leadership 
tasks in a parallel configuration as 
setting 
policy, instigating organizational 
change, and making sure that 

the right things get done

 
(p.
 
53).
 
33
 
 
Foster
 
(1989) sugges
ted that managerial writers have appropriated the 
language of leadership, 

translated [it] into the needs of bureaucracy,

 
and fed 
it 
back to educators, so that this particular discourse of leadership 

appears as a way 
of improving organizations, not of tr
ansforming our world

 
(p.
 
45). Educational 
leadership, he added, has been further reduced to a 

how
-
to

 
manual for would
-
be 
managers. Although schools share common managerial requirements for 
organization, structure, and stability with the business communi
ty (Sergiovanni, 
2000), management is not the same as leadership.
 
English (2008) posited that managers do not generally question many 
aspects of organizations, 
whereas 
leaders may be more apt to engage in 
examinations of 

purposes, procedures, and organiza
tional borders

 
(p.
 
14). 
According to 
Foster
 
(1989), the goals of the education leader should be related to 
social change or human emancipation and not to performance
 
as defined by goal 
achievement, 
reflected in the needs of an organization in business. Le
adership in 
business is often used to attain various objectives by using power to benefit not 
the community, but the individual. These objectives tend to treat people as means 
and focus primarily on achievement and what works, rather than on 

creating the 
public

 
(Dewey, 1916; as 
cited 
in Carson, 2005
, p.
 
1).
 
The purposes of education rooted in managerial models of school 
leadership are often aligned with requirements for accountability in national or 
provincial educational reform (Heck & Hallinger, 1999;
 
L
evin, 
2001
; Taylor, 
2001; 
Wallace, 
2004;
 
Young, 2002). McWilliam (2000) contended that schools 
are gradually being reshaped into corporations to improve productivity and that 
34
 
 
school administrators are under increasing pressure to 

develop themselves as 
ent
erprising leaders and managers

 
(p.
 
75).
 
The Concept of Teacher Leadership
 
 
The concept of teacher leadership as a model of leadership underpins the 
role of the new AP. In the two school boards that I examined, building teacher 
leadership was the primary f
ocus of their leadership training and formation 
programs. Teacher leadership as a concept emerged in the early 
1990s 
with the 
onset of broad
-
based movements in education such as school
-
based management 
and professionalism (Murp
hy, 2005). According to Murph
y
, no longer did the 
traditional view of the principal as hierarchical with power flowing down shape 
all school sites. As part of a restructuring of schools, the principal role became 
that of a transformational leader (Hallinger, 1992). According to Blase 
and Kirby 
(2000), transformational leadership is based on Burns

 
(1978) belief that this type 
of leader helps to develop followers by p
aying them individual attention;
 
for 
example, 
by 
attending to their professional growth and challenging the existing 
orde
r. They further pointed out that the two requirements for effective teacher 
leadership 
are 
the administrator

s commitment to developing teachers and the 
teachers

 
commitment to expanding their roles beyond the classroom, as well as 
becoming more accountabl
e for these activities. Lambert (2003) agreed that the 
role of the teacher leader complements the function of the school administrators 
because the teacher

s expertise is recognized and valued and supports the many 
leadership tasks that evolve in the schoo
l. Blase 
and Kirby 
explained that teachers 
must subsequently seize 
the 
opportunities 
that 
administrators 
offer 
because 
they 
35
 
 
afford
 
them more
 
decision
-
making power. Murphy 
noted that teacher expertise 
is 
now 
the basis for influence in these relationships.
 
T
eacher leadership is difficult to reduce to one understanding, similar to 
conceptions of leadership. Danielson (2006) identified nine dispositions of a 
teacher leader that included a deep commitment to student learning, open
-
mindedness and humility, persev
erance and willingness to work hard, creative 
flexibility, and a tolerance for ambiguity. Murphy (2005) investigated over a 
dozen studies, each with a unique understanding of teacher leadership and its 
purposes. Some teacher leaders, he explained, are moti
vated by career 
advancement, 
whereas 
others perceive that stepping up their participation in 
school is a vehicle to build a professional community 
to improve
 
student learning. 
Wasley (1992; as cited in Murphy, 2005) added that teacher leadership engages 
co
lleagues 
in 
improved practice. Lambert (1998) reminded us that teacher leaders 
act out of a sense of self and shared values. She also observed that a nurtured 
adult learning environment enables the development of teacher leadership and that 
every teacher h
as 

the right, responsibility and capability to become a leader

 
(Lambert, 2003
, p.
 
33). According to Lambert, the knowledge, skills, and 
attributes of an effective teacher include the development and support of a culture 
for self
-
reflection, the promotion
 
of collaborative decision making, and the ability 
to work with others to construct knowledge through inquiry. Overall, the concept 
of developing teacher leader
s
 
implies a relationship between leaders and followers 
that is relational and reduce
s
 
hierarchic
al distinctions.
 
36
 
 
Poststructuralist Interpretation of Identity
 
In this study
 
poststructuralist theory framed
 
the question of identity 
around 
discursive practices of leadership that 
affect
 
the identity formation of subjects 
who are becoming 
AP
s. Poststructur
alist theory is represented by a diverse range 
of theories that examine the relation between language, subjectivity, power, and 
social organization. 
Weedon (1997)
 
reminded us that by 
including 
power relations 
and values, poststructuralism explores the unde
rlying assumptions and types of 
discourses from which particular questions
 
arise
 
and locates them socially and 
institutionally. She explained t
hat poststructuralism originated
 
in Saussure

s work 
on struc
tural linguistics that described
 
language as a chain 
of signs made up of 
signifiers (written images or sounds) whose relationship to its signifieds 
(meanings) is arbitrary and without fixed and intrinsic meanings. Lye (1997) 
described poststructuralism as a 

set of theoretical positions, which have at their 
core a self
-
reflexive discourse which is aware of the tentativeness, the 
slipperiness, the ambiguity and the complex interrelations of texts and meanings

 
(
¶
 
1). Britzman (2003) agreed that all meaning is an active construct, wholly 
dependent upon language
 
and context. She observed that language both produces 
and limits our understanding of how society and reality are constructed.
 
Identity, Discourse, and Poststructuralism
 
A poststructuralist perspective on identity describes the concept of self not 
as unit
ary, fixed, or stable (Hall, 1996), but 
as 
a configuration that occupies 

various culturally based sit
es of meaning

 
(Lye, 1997, Part
 
II). Hall posited that 
identities are constructed 

within, not outside discourse [and] produced in specific 
37
 
 
historical and
 
institutional sites within specific discursive formations and 
practices

 
(p.
 
4
). 
He explained that how we represent ourselves 
depends
 
upon 
the 
ways 
that 
we have used 

the resources of history, language and culture in the 
process of becoming

 
(p.
 
4) within
 
these discourses. 
Weedon (1997)
 
asserted that 
the self is in fact a fragmentation of selves, exemplified by the variety of subject 
positions taken up in social interactions. Fairbanks and Ariail (2006) pointed out 
that some subject positions are invoked b
y specific and fami
liar story
lines such as 
m
om, dad, teacher, and principal
 
and that the familiarity of these roles 
overdetermines their meanings. They emphasized that when an individual 
negotiates his or her response to a particular subject position, this
 
creates 
opportunities for creative responses, agency, and even a transformation of the 
individual

s subject position.
 
Cultural Myths and Identity Formation
 
In her work on the identity formation of new teachers, 
Britzman (2003) 
provided an example o
f how i
dentities are negotiated
. She claimed that problems 
with identity emerge for student teachers as they take on the role of teacher and 
that this tension in 
becoming a teacher 
is reframed as an ongoing social 
negotiation. Britzman (1994) proposed that people
 
(she referred primarily to 
student teachers) consent to representing themselves by certain discourses and 
that these discourses are 

already overburdened with the discourses of others

 
(p.
 
56). In other words, student teachers may experience moments of st
ruggle in 
their attempts to reconcile those constructs that currently define them as teachers 
(their history, education, situation, and 
understandings of experience)
 
with the 
38
 
 
expectations associated with their new role usually laid out by others. Some of 
t
hese expectations take the form of what Britzman (2003) called 
cultural myths 
to 
become the discursive practices that shape teacher identities. According to 
Britzman, these discursive practices 

narrate a heroic story of a self
-
made 
profession that can ris
e above beleaguered education

 
(p.
 
6). She explained these 
myths as follows:
 
First, e
verything 
depends on the teacher
,
 
and learning is only 
constructed simultaneously with teacher control
. Second
, 
the teacher is the expert; 
the teacher knows how to teach a
nd knows everything 
that 
there is to know about 
the material. T
hird
, teachers are born, not made; 
in beginning to teach, 
the teacher 
has to undergo a trial by fire to confirm 
either 
that his or her skills are innate or 
that they are learned.
 
To expand this
 
view into educational administration, 
AP
s 
face 
similar 
myths as normative practices in the leadership field. Everything may 
appear to 
depend on the leader, who 
may present him
-
 
or herself as the sole producer of 
knowledge
;
 
and, as English (2008) posited, 
connota
tions of leadership that derive
 
from hero narratives continue to characterize leaders today, for the most part, with 
a trial by fire. APs formulate conceptions of what it is to be a good administrator 
from these types of cultural myths and measure 
t
hem 
against their own internal 
discourses and actual practices. Their understandings of leadership p
ractices are 
conveyed in school
-
community expectations, district directives, books and 
articles, po
licy manuals, and administrator
-
evaluation documents, as 
well as in the 
narratives of others in the field. Hence, if their perception of themselves as 
39
 
 

good

 
leaders is destabilized in the process of becoming leader
s
 
and as a result 
of the conceptions of others, then identity becomes a site of struggle.
 
Identi
ty
, 
Learning
, and Resistance
 
 
Bracher 
(2006) described identity a
s 

a sense of oneself as a force that 
matters in the world

 
(p.
 
6). This sense of self is generated by our individual 
experience of 

continuity, agency, distinction, belonging, and meaning

 
(p.
 
6), all 
unique qualities essential to identity that provide us with feedback from the world 
and assist in interpreting 
our 
effect on others. To foster an adequate sense of self, 
Bracher explained that we need 

recognition

 
(p.
 
7), which means that we have
 
a 
basic need to be appreciated, validated, and acknowledged by others. People gain 
recognition in the ways that they present themselves, either by self
-
describing and 
expressing their attitudes
 
or 
by 
attempt
ing
 
to manage others

 
impressions of 
themselves.
 
Recognition, according to Bracher, is also a fundamental motivator in 
supporting or interfering with learning, including learning that takes place in 
institutional settings.
 
Bracher (2006) observed that learning is motivated by a person

s effort to 
mainta
in and enhance identity. Every time we learn something, Bracher pointed 
out, our very identity is destabilized because, to some extent, we resist the new 
knowledge and change. When new 
AP
s take on the role of educational leaders, 
they typically learn the t
asks associated with their role but they also learn about 
themselves and their identity, and 
they may also resist 
this knowledge. Britzman 
(1998) argu
ed
 
that when the knowledge encountered is perceived to 
threaten
 
one

s ego, it may provoke a crisis within 
the self. Drawing on work from Anna 
40
 
 
Freud, Britzman observed that because people work hard to assert their sense of 
continuity, their response may be a refusal to learn when the knowledge 

at first 
glance seems senseless, dangerous, or worrisome

 
(p.
 
10). 
This refusal or 
resistance may be a brief occurrence as the self negotiates links to existing 
understandings and integrates the information or sensation. Conversely, resistance 
may take the 
form of a defenc
e mechanism that disallows the linking for any 
num
ber of reasons. Bracher contended that enacting defence mechanisms prevents 
identities from 

becoming more inte
grated, complex, and capacious

 
(p.
 
53
) and 
that a healthy approach to greater i
ntegration occurs through the 
process of 
working through.
 
Authori
tative Discourses That Shape
 
Educational
 
Leadership Practice
 
Authoritative discourses are frameworks or conditions within a culture 
that shape human perception and identity sometimes through the use of 

special 
and sacred language

 
(Bakhtin, 1981
, p.
 
342),
 
but also at times, authoritative 
discourses are expressed through the use of everyday 
words (English, 1994). 
Bakhtin 
characterized authoritative discourses as 

moral

 
or as 

the word of a 
father, of adults and of teachers

 
(p.
 
342) to underscore the great
 
power 
of 
authoritative discourses over the way that we think and behave. 
Bakhtin described 
a
uthoritative discourses as embodying various contents such as 

generally 
acknowledged truths,

 

the official line,

 
and 

the authoritativeness of tradition

 
(p.
 
34
4), 
which all require
 
unconditional allegiance 
from 
those within the sphere 
of influence. Britzman (2003) drew heavily on 
the work of 
Bakhtin to describe 
41
 
 
ways 
in which 
authoritative discourses
,
 
or the 

persistency of particular 
worldviews, orientations, di
spositions, and cultural myths that dominate our 
thinking

 
(p.
 
27), make available or deny certain practices in educational life. 
Authoritative discourses, according to her, are articulated and enshrined in texts 
and practices
,
 
and their influence is evide
nt in how we interact in families, 
institutions 
such as 
school, and places of worship. Popkewitz (1987) agreed that 
discourse sets the conditions by which events are interpreted and individuals 
located. He added that discourse is the space that defines peo
ple from birth and, 
subsequently, the space that in fact shapes their identity. Allan
 
et
 
al
.
 
(2006) noted 
that some discourses can be recognized by the ways in which they have become 
taken for granted and naturalized, but most are, in fact, invisible.
 
Auth
oritative discourses become normalized practice and are commonly 
accepted by cultural groups without critical examination. Consenting to them 
generally makes sense because the discourses affirm or reinforce familiar 
practices. However, there are some pract
ices shaped by these external 
authoritative discourses that a person

s internal position challenges. For Bakhtin 
(1981), it is at this intersection of challenge, in the 

struggle and dialogic 
interrelationship

 
of personally persuasive discourse and author
itative discourses, 
that the 

history of an individual ideological consciousness

 
(p.
 
342) is 
determined; it is here that identity is negotiated. Bakhtin explained that, at some 
early point in our lives, our consciousness awakens to ideological life. Howev
er, 
this awakening occurs in a world of discourses unfamiliar to us and from which 
42
 
 
we 

cannot initially separate

 
(p.
 
345
) 
ourselves. He added that, at the moment 
when tho
ught begins to work in
 
an independent, experimenting and discriminating way, what fir
st occurs 
is a separation between internally persuasive discourse and authoritarian 
enforced discourses, along with a rejection of those congeries of 
discourses that do not matter to us, that do not touch us
. 
(p.
 
345)
 
Our consciousness, or personally persu
asive discourse, then begins to engage in 
an ongoing process of selectively assimilating the words (ideas, practices) of 
others and of continually negotiating new meanings about ourselves and about the 
world around us.
 
Woven throughout this literature revi
ew are hints at broad discourses that 
in effect shape perceptions of leadership and greatly influence leader identity. 
Some of these authoritative discourses are closely connected to one another
,
 
and 
others compete for dominance and control. Certain author
itative discourses that I 
have distinguished are more discernible in structures such as the tension in power 
relationship
s in schools, the effect of neo
liberal policies on leadership practices, 
and the impact of Catholic discourses of leadership. However, 
more elusive 
authoritative discourses 
also 
shape leadership behaviours and identities. These 
discourses, upon examination, reveal the cultural myths and the expectations 
surrounding leadership roles that develop in a society and become the accepted 
norm in
 
a school community; they are equally powerful discursive practices that a 
first
-
year 
AP
 
may encounter upon 
assuming 
a new administrative role.
 
Power and Authoritative Discourses of Educational Leadership
 
Structures that authorize contemporary leadership a
re produced by social 
power, context, and relationship (Allan
 
et
 
al
., 
2006). Citing Sawicki (1991), Allan 
43
 
 
et
 
al
. noted that the traditional configurations of power

power is possessed, 
flows from the top down, and is primarily prohibitive or repressive

cons
truct
 
the 
leader as one who wields most of the power and operates in a hierarchical 
structure populated by followers or minions.
 
Foucault

s (1980; as cited in Allan 
et
 
al
., 2006) power theory, they claimed, reframes this type of traditional power as 
more g
enerative rather than coercive and prohibitive. This reconceptualization of 
power no longer focuses analysis on the leader who possesses power, but on the 
leader as one who is constituted through the exercise of power and the power 
relation networks. The c
oncept of individual leadership, according to Allan 
et
 
al
., 
now shifts from notions of personal autonomy to an understanding of power as 
shared in consensual and collaborative ways. These authors also drew on Allen

s 
(1999) conceptual distinctions that fra
me power in three modalities

power
-
over, 
power
-
with, and powe
r
-
to

to reflect various degrees of intentionality, collective 
action, and empowerment within leadership relationships.
 
Authoritative Discourses of Autonomy and Relatedness
 
Allan 
et
 
al
. (2006) dev
eloped a conceptual framework 
to identify
 
two 
dominant discourses of leadership: one, a discourse of autonomy that subsumes 
the discourses of 
masculinity and professionalism;
 
and the other, a discourse of 
relatedness. They drew on Foucault

s (1978) work to
 
explore forms of productive 
power that connect to discursive structures that shape leader identity. Their 
discursive leadership framework offered a good starting point for 
a 
discussion 
on 
the images of leadership 
that unfold 
in my research participants

 
n
arratives. A 
44
 
 
brief overview of each of the discourses of autonomy, relatedness, 
professionalism, and masculinity follows.
 
The discourse of autonomy, according to Allan 
et
 
al
. (2006), shapes 
images of an autonomous, masculine leader who is self
-
governing, m
orally 
principled, and 

independent from close interpersonal relationships

 
(p.
 
49); the 
solo leader

s close association with masculine constructs shapes the subject 
position of a tyrant. Conversely, they describe
d
 
the subject position of a leader
-
facilita
tor, shaped within a discourse of relatedness, as an alternative to 
the 
autonomous leader. This non
traditional way of thinking about leadership 
reconceptualizes power as shared with others in a seemingly leaderless 
environment comprised of self
-
organizing 
and temporary networks. The discourse 
of relatedness focuses on process and extends its influence to the ideals of shared 
and participative leadership models. Allan 
et
 
al
. suggested that the intersection of 
the discour
ses of relatedness and autonomy produc
es 
the subject position of 
negotiator. The characteristics of the negotiator draw on the qualities of both the 
autonomous and 
the 
relational leader; here, they not only assume 

the leader

s 
right to self
-
govern

 
but also his or her obligation to 

delineate
 
and critique [the] 
social conditions

 
(p.
 
56) that impact goal attainment and 
promote social
-
justice 
ends. As well, Allan 
et
 
al
. noted that the negotiator position receives political 
legitimacy in exchange for sharing power with what they call
ed
 
the 
endor
sing 
community
.
 
The discourse of professionalism, according to Allan 
et
 
al
. (2006)
,
 
is 
characterized by a focus on the individual improvement, professional 
45
 
 
development, and specialized knowledge of the consummate educational expert. 
In 
developing 
a self
-
re
flective leader who adheres to the regulation of standards 
and whose goals are to have or to gain credentials, it is a discourse that is 
considered to be 

inherently good or morally right

 
(Allan, 2003; as cited in Allan 
et
 
al
., 2006
, p.
 
51). The subject p
ositions that are taken up within the framework 
of this discourse include the expert and the beneficiary. 
Linked 
with the 
masculinity discourse, however, the discourse on professionalism produces 
images of leaders as 
heroes, statesmen, and warriors and oft
en combines
 
constructs of toughness with expertise in the field. The masculinity discourse 
takes for granted that masculine traits represent desired leader behaviours. Allan 
et
 
al
. explained that this type of autonomous leader advances the collective 
purpo
se of the group by being attuned to the needs and aspirations of his or her 
followers, but does not work for individual recognition alone. Furthermore, the 
warrior subject position, more distanced from the discourse on professionalism, 
operates in an envir
onment akin to a battleground. Many familiar analogies are 
used with this construct in schools; for example, 

leaders draw fire

 
and 

teachers 
work on the front line.

 
Neoliberal Authoritative Discourses That Shape Educational Leadership
 
Valuing efficiency
.
 
In his review of the literature on educational 
leadership, English (2008) posited that the dominant authoritative discourse in the 
educational field today remains a discourse of efficiency in its 

models, standards, 
and approach to preparation

 
(p.
 
145).
 
He pointed out that the foundations 
of this 
discourse

the influence of scientific management combined with the conc
ept of 
46
 
 
total quality management

continue to influence organizations because it is 
thought 
that any organization can always become more effec
tive and efficient. 
English noted that for nearly 
100 
years the discourse of efficiency has prevailed to 
reinforce a paradigm that calls for education to be run like a business. He added 
that very little will change in this regard partly 
because of 
the man
y laws 
that 
demand
 
increased accountability 
and 
are linked with the move to a globalized 
economy.
 
Research that 
has chronicled
 
the effects of globalization on education 
practices and policies 
has suggested
 
that the Anglo
-
American shift to a globalized 
econ
omy is evident in discourses that emphasize managerial and market 
accountability (
Blackmore, 2004; 
Levin, 
2001;
 
Taylor, 2001; Wallace, 2004). 
Some of the ways that these discourses have been taken up in education reform 
are embedded in new managerialism an
d performativity discourses that are 

articulated within a lexicon of enterprise, excellence, quality and effectiveness

 
(Gewirtz & Ball, 2000
, p.
 
255). The shift from a welfarist state to new forms of 
governance is a move away from discourses that reflect
 
beliefs anchored in such 
values as c
aringness, value for
 
all children equally, democratic participation, and 
social transformation (Gewirtz & Ball, 2000). Gewirtz and Ball noted that the 
emphasis arising from new managerialism discourses is
,
 
moreover
,
 
foc
used on the 

instrumental purpose of schooling
,

 
the 
goals 
of which 
are to raise standards and 
performance 

as measured by examination results, levels of attendance, and 
school
-
leaver destinations

 
(p.
 
256). They asserted that new managers or leaders 
47
 
 
lead 
with vision towards the above purposes and that this type of leadership is 
largely uncritical.
 
Valuing performativity.
 
Like discourses of efficiency, performativity 
discourses are rooted in the marketplace. Performativity, according to Ball (2003), 
is fore
grounded as the performances of individuals or organizations that 

serve as 
measures of productivity or output, or displays of 

quality,

 
or 

moments

 
of 
promotion or inspection

;
 
and as such, within a field of judgement, they are 

represented by the worth
, quality or values of an individual or [of an] 
organization

 
(p.
 
216). Blackmore (2004) explained that performativity 
leads to 
more compliance 
with 
institutional practices because teachers (and presumably 
other educators) have no control over government p
olicies; as a result, there is 
less critical dialogue as fear and anger are played out.
 
Wallace (2004) proposed that t
he effects of performativity involve 
significant shifts in 
the 
purposes of schooling as represented in 
the 
media and 
public policy texts a
nd 

the homogenizing effects of globalized capitalism on 
social, political, and economic values

 
(Manzer, 2003; as cited in Wallace, 2004
, 
p.
 
2). Wallace argued that public schooling has been commodified
 
to
 
reproduce 
particular values that are rooted in th
e marketplace rather than in the public good. 
Ball (2003) explained that the rhetoric 
on educational reforms has
 
an inordinately 
broad scope 
in that 
they establish a new form of control that makes it possible to 
govern in an advanced liberal way. However, 
within this structure, he pointed out
,
 
teachers 

are encouraged to 

add value

 
to themselves, improve their productivity, 
strive for excellence and live an existence of calculation

 
(p.
 
217). Blackmore 
48
 
 
(2004) confirmed that in restructured school systems, 
teachers 
a
re recognized 
more for their performance outside the classroom; she ad
ded that principals 
have 
also reduce
d
 
their focus on educational leadership in favour of 

image and 
financial, personnel and resource management

 
(p.
 
444). Ball 
noted 
that the 
self 
rather than the collective takes precedence
 
and
 
that pressure to be competitive and 
to 
perform is evident in site
-
based management discourses 
that encourage 
institutions 

to make themselves different from one another, to stand out, to 

improve

 
themse
lves

 
(p.
 
219) within the constraints of reduced budgets (Taylor, 
2001; 
Young, 2002),
 
thus replacing older forms of cooperation and collective 
relations.
 
Authoritative Discourses of Catholic Educational Leadership
 
In this study I 
have 
focus
ed
 
on APs in Cat
holic schools, which 
necessitates addressing aspects of the particular ideological beliefs and meanings 
that constitute discourses of Catholicity. As 
I 
discussed in 
c
hapter
 
one
, a Catholic 
school must serve all people without judgment and be committed to t
he 
cultivation of human values, which are also Gospel values. Gospel values are 
rooted in the teachings of Jesus Christ, which Groome (1998) described as 
signifying a 

special outreach to the poor, oppressed, and marginalized

 
(p.
 
369), 
and this then becom
es the impetus for social justice. Gospel values are variously 
described as constituting respect for life and dignity for each individual, trust in 
God, servant leadership, compassion, mercy, and justice (Notre Dame Preparatory 
School, 2007). Each Catholic
 
school district articulates these values in 
its 
religious programs, mission and vision statements, and evaluation documents, as 
49
 
 
well as in 
its 
annual reports for the province

s Ministry of Education. However, 
there is tension between discourses of Catholi
city and current educational reforms 
that are shaped by marketplace discourses.
 
 
Sergiovanni (2000) explored whether the gospel message of 

community 
and service

 
as the 

preeminent purpose of Catholic education

 
(p.
 
x) could 
enable the preservation and gr
owth of Catholic institutional cultures within the 
context of reform in the United States. Building on Habermas

 
(1987) theoretical 
framework of communicative action, which posits that all 
of 

society

s 
enterprises

 
(Sergiovanni, 2000
, p.
 
ix) or organizati
ons have a lifeworld and a 
systemsworld, Sergiovanni examined the impact of reform initiatives in American 
public schools. He observed that these initiatives led to the colonization of a 
school

s lifeworld by the systemsworld
,
 
and the resultant impact was 
more 
significant for publicly funded 
than for 
private schools. In this province the public 
school system includes Catholic and other religious schools that are therefore 
subject to the same provincial reforms. To some extent, Catholic school districts 
seem
 
to have become institutions with little ability to resist this colonizing effect.
 
 
In this chapter I reviewed the literature on the role of the 
AP
, its origins, 
how it has changed in the past 80 years, and it
s
 
many appeals and challenges. I 
described the 
relationship between 
the 
AP role and identity formation, primarily 
by 
closely 
examining two books that represent 
the mainstream literature on new
-
AP leadership. I examined the literature on diverse understandings of educational 
l
eadership that include
 
tran
sformational, mor
al, and managerial perspectives
 
and 
reviewed the concept of teacher leadership. Poststructuralist theory frames 
50
 
 
questions of identity in my study around authoritative discourses of leadership 
that shape educational leadership practice. The
 
authoritative discourses that I 
identified 
from 
the data in the study, 
which 
are accepted, resisted, or negotiated 
by the personally persuasive discourses of new 
AP
s, are evident in the 
relationships of power within schools and school districts, neolibera
l influences, 
and discourses of C
atholic educational leadership.
 
 
In the next chapter I explain how 
I 
gathered and interpreted 
the data 
using 
and ethnographic interview t
o understand the identity formation of first
-
year 
AP
s.
 
51
 
 
CHAPTER THREE:
 
AN 
ETHNOGRAPHIC
 
APPROACH TO UNDERSTANDING THE 
IDENTITY FORMATION OF ASSISTANT PRINCIPALS
 
A
n
 
Ethnographic Approach
 
 
The methodology that I use
d
 
in the study 
wa
s an ethnographic interview. 

(Merriam, 
1988, p. 72) was to obtain the perspectives of the participants by 
drawing on their
 
past and present experiences and by encouraging them to voice 
their thoughts and understandings as they negotiate their identities as educational 
leaders. 
This methodology 
supports 
a poststructuralist orientation, which 
emphasizes language 
and the analysis of the spoken words of the participants 
(Spradley, 1979).
 
Background to Ethnography
 
Traditional ethnography, according to Agar (1996), forms part of a body 
of social, cult
ural, and human research 
that 
grew out of Western traditions of 
scientific research and was developed to accommodate inquiry about humans and 
other conscious beings. Wolcott (2003) reminded us that the purpose of any 
ethnographic study is 

to provide descr
iption and analysis regarding human social 
behaviour

 
(p.
 
xv)
,
 
whether o
f
 
a 
particular group of people or of
 
some special 
human process. Ethnography is such an approach
,
 
and
,
 
as a qualitative 
methodology, it makes e
xplicit and public the
 
ways of understand
ing humans and 
ways of knowing the world (Agar, 1996; Britzman, 2003). Britzman explained 
that, through ethnography, we construct and organize people

s experiences to be 
52
 
 
able to make sense of what happens to us. She contended
,
 
however, that this very 
act o
f constructing and organizing on the part of the researcher problematizes 
traditional ethnography.
 
Problems With Traditional Ethnography
 
Britzman (2003) argued that the reader of an ethnographic account is 
drawn into a narrated world and into the subjectiv
ities of its residents, expecting 
the ethnographer to produce the truths of the cultural secrets. She cautioned that 
the textualized qualities of such an account provide easy access 
to 
a culture by 
blurring 

traditional distinctions among the writer, the r
eader, the story, and how 
the stories are told

 
(p.
 
243). Britzman also questioned the authority of language 
in ethnography. She called attention to the ambiguity and elusiveness of language 
with respect to what the participants and the researcher
 
say
 
and 
alerted the reader 
to be watchful for what 
they leave 
unsaid. Carspecken (2001) emphasized the 
importance of the way that language is 

used rather than the way individuals 
experience perception

 
(p.
 
7) in his attempt to circumvent inaccuracies in 
represent
ations of social life. He explained that there is no ground for determining 
the 
accuracy of one representation over another. Carspecken also observed that 
representations are always acts of power that have the potential to subjugate the 
peoples and culture
s that are described to the researcher. Pignatelli (1998) pointed 
out that
,
 
because the crisis of representation is strongly linked to the role of the 
researcher as a producer of knowledge, authors must 

continually invent ways to 
extend interpretive power
 
beyond [their own] borders

 
(p.
 
405). From a 
poststructuralist stance as a researcher and producer of knowledge, and with 
53
 
 
respect to the subjective experiences of new AP participants in two Catholic 
scho
ol districts, I have striven
 
to maintain 
my 
awarenes
s of my own sense of 
power
-
as
-
author throughout this creative process of cultural representation. I 
acknowledge that the descriptions and interpretations in this ethnographic study 
can only be partial and biased within the larger cultural context of the ex
periences 
of APs, and I acknowledge that 
my own interests have shaped 
this study.
 
Research Design
 
Data Sources
 
My research inquiry consisted of collecting information from four main 
sources: 
(a)
 
two interviews with three 
AP
s within the first year of a scho
ol
-
based 
administrative position
,
 
two of 
whom 
were employed in the same Catholic school 
district and one 
in 
a second Catholic school district
;
 
both school districts 
are 
in a 
Western 
Canadian province; 
(b)
 
one interview 
with 
each 
of 
two educational 
leaders 
at the district level who guide leadership formation within their respective 
Catholic school districts and who provided a school district perspective and 
context for the 
AP
s in the study; 
(c)
 
Web
-
based and print documents from the two 
Catholic school distr
icts that included their foundation statements, evaluation 
criteria, 
three
-
year plans, and annual reports; and 
(d)
 
Web
-
based documents from 
the province

s Ministry of Education.
 
Selection of Participants and Influential Leadership Texts
 
For this study on h
ow new APs negotiate their identities as school
-
based 
leaders, 
I selected 
three urban and rural Catholic school districts in a province in 
Western Canada based on their proximity and on permission 
from 
their 
54
 
 
superintendents to conduct research. In spite of
 
the fact that I gained
 
entry into all 
three boards, 
one of the boards had 
no first
-
year APs at the junior high level that 
year
,
 
and
,
 
as a result, I focused my research on the other two boards.
 
My contact with a colleague in the MCSD 
(
a pseudonym
)
, enabled
 
me to 
secure an introduction to the superintendent and to obtain permission to approach 
potential participants. The MCSD is a large rural district 
that employs
 
330 
teachers in 
18 schools and serves
 
over 6
,
700 students. The district was formed in 
the mid
-
1
990s
, 
which brought 
together three formerly independent school 
districts, two of which were established in the late 1800s. 
The g
overnance of this 
board reflects a traditional structure that includes trustees, the 
s
uperintendent, 
the 
d
eputy 
s
uperintendent o
f Leadership Services and Human Resources, 
the a
ssistant 
s
uperintendent responsible for Learning Services, a director of Student Services
,
 
a 
director of Technology Services, 
and 
five consultants connected with Learning 
Services and Religious Services. The 
district

s mission is to be a welcoming, 
Christ
-
centered learning community within an environment rooted in Catholic 
principles.
 
The other school district that permitted me to approach 
its 
staff for this 
study was TCSD 
(
also a pseudonym
)
. This urban school
 
district, located in a 
medium
-
sized city, employs over 1
,
800 teachers in 
80 
schools with 35,000 
students. The district has 
existed
 
for over 
100 
years 
and delivers
 
the curriculum 
within a Catholic context and with a 
mission and vision that inspire and prep
are
 
students to learn and to serve God in one another, 
which results
 
in the 
op
timization
 
of 
the 
human potential 
of the 
students in 
its 
trust. The structur
e of 
55
 
 
TCSD includes the trustees;
 
s
uperintendent
;
 
a
ssistant 
s
uperintendents of 
Leadership, Learning, Te
chnology, Facilities, Human Resources, and Religious 
Services
;
 
and more than 
30 
consultants 
who support
 
teachers and students in 
religious instruction, special education, technology, and curriculum.
 
In each of the two participating Catholic school boards I
 
contact
ed
 
a staff 
member at the district level who was responsible for leadership training programs. 
The district leaders, who were senior administrators, in turn gave me 
the 
names of 
AP
s who met my criteria 
of 
APs who were 
working at the junior high leve
l 
(
Grades
 
7
 
to 
9) and 
had assumed their positions 
within 
the last 
one to three 
years. 
I chose Catholic school districts in an attempt to capture a unique perspective that 
links faith formation and the formation of Catholic educational leaders and 
because I
 
currently work in a Catholic district. A benefit of the research 
personally was to deepen my own understanding of the experience of others 
within a similar faith
-
based environment. van Manen (2003) asserted that 

we 
gather other people

s experiences becau
se they allow us to become more 
experienced ourselves

 
(p.
 
62). I am also curious about how the discourse of 
being Catholic shapes the administrative experience. There is a shifting focus in 
the leadership 
literature that explores how to make life more spi
ritual and 
meaningful (Doe
tze
l, 2005).
 
What influence do
 
acknowledging and sharing 
spiritual experiences and rituals have on the shaping of Catholic leaders? In what 
ways are these influences being eroded by other discourses?
 
Each 
of the school boards at t
he district level
 
had
 
at least three senior 
administrators who qualified as district leaders who influenced leadership in their 
56
 
 
jurisdiction
s
. The district leader role 
enhances
 
the leadership capacity of staff in 
the school district through a range of init
iatives: 
the selection and 
succession 
planning 
of school
-
based administrators
, leadership development programs, and
,
 
possibly, partnerships with 
Catholic educational institutions. L
eadership 
develop
ment programs typically include
 
a program for staff member
s who 
a
re 
considering school
-
based leadership for the first time and for APs who 
have 
demonstrated their readiness for an appointment to the principalship in the near
 
future; a program that provides
 
training, support, and mentorship to first
-
year 
principal
s
; and an initiative to encourage
 
and 
offer 
collegial support 
to 
first
-
year 
A
Ps. Other district
-
leader responsibilities include
 
liaising with postsecondary 
institutions in the area of graduate programs for school
-
based leaders, 
collaborating with district 
principals to 
offer 
support and advice to school 
principals, 
and 
supporting principals in their work of supervising and evaluating 
teachers.
 
The interviews that I conducted with district personnel who guided 
the 
leadership formation programs in two Catholi
c school boards helped me to gather 
information and anecdotes 
on 
their respective district

s leadership
-
related 
practices and perspectives. I supplemented their interviews with documents 
that 
originated
 
in 
each district.
 
In the process of recruiting AP par
ticipants in three boards in Western 
Canada, I intended to balance the number of women and men and considered 
factors such as age and whether 
they had 
children at home to ensure a diversity of 
perspectives. I was also cognizant of subject
-
area specialties 
to avoid duplicating 
57
 
 
context. Because of my desire to investigate 
primarily 
the experiences of new APs 
at the junior high level, I preferred to enlist participants only at secondary schools.
 
During the recruiting process I engaged many APs in casual conver
sation 
about 
their inception into educational administration. It soon became apparent that 
APs who were in their second or third year of administrative work had already 
lost their sense of tentativeness and were now more philosophical about their 
beginning
 
months as administrative leaders. 
Because 
it was my intention to 
capture the initial experiences in the transition from teach
er
 
to educational leader, 
my pool of pote
ntial participants suddenly shra
nk 
because 
far fewer people 
met 
the
 
criterion
 
of first ye
ar at a junior high school. 
In 
fact, 
one board had no first
-
year APs in junior high school, a second board
 
had one male
, and 
a third board 
had 
two new APs, a male and a female. 
I contacted e
ach of these prospective 
participants by e
-
mail and followed up so
on after with a phone call to clarify the 
scope and intent of my research. The three new A
Ps all agreed to be interviewed:
 
Brian 
was 
is in his early
 
40s
, Roger 
was 
in his late
 
30
, and Maxine 
was 
in her 
mid
-
40s
. All are Caucasian, of Canadian descent, and m
arried
;
 
Brian and Maxine 
have 
children. Brian spent most of his 18 years as a teacher and department head 
of physical education and social studies in 
a high school, whereas Roger had
 
taught a variety of subjects including French, Italian, mathematics, soci
al studies, 
religious studies, and English language arts for 14 years
,
 
almost exclusively in 
junior high. Maxine 
had 
taught for 15 years in elementary schools, then after three 
years as a project manager, she taught junior high for three years. All of thes
e 
research participants seemed genuinely interested in engaging in conversation 
on 
58
 
 
the process of becoming an AP and how 
the 
identities of new APs are negotiated. 
The n
ew APs especially seemed to appreciate the opportunity to voice their 
experiences.
 
Of th
e many possible texts that contribute to the formation of AP 
identities, I gathered, examined, and analyzed a select
ed
 
number that pointed 
toward
s
 
leadership practices within each of the two school boards. The purpose 
of 
gathering
 
these 
data was to gain an
 
understanding of the discursive practices that 
shape the thinking and actions of school leaders. The texts included each school 
district

s general information on 
its Web sites;
 
for example, mission and vision 
statements, three
-
year plans, and annual repor
ts. I also acquired administrator 
evaluation documents as well as provincial documents 
that described
 
educational 
reforms, 
including
 
newly proposed standards to streamline principal
s

 
practice;
 
and
,
 
finally, one district

s policies that guide the leadershi
p practice of APs.
 
Role of the Researcher
 
Tricoglus (2001) 
described 
the researcher 
a
s inevitably a part of the 
research scene
,
 
and it is 

therefore necessary to identify for one

s self the role 
being sought

 
(p.
 
144). My 
researcher 
position 
wa
s more 
one o
f 
practitioner 
researcher than participant observer. In many ways I was more fully present to 
this investigation because, like my participants, I was equally immersed in the 
process of becoming an 
AP
. My objective to come to a deeper understanding of 
how A
Ps in Catholic school districts experience their social and cultural worlds 
also compelled me to continually rethink my assumptions about leading within a 
Catholic context and the extent to which I uncritically accepted certain discursive 
59
 
 
practices as norm
al and right. My understanding of the school site and its 
nuances
,
 
however
,
 
served me well because I was an interviewer who could 
genuinely engage in meaningful dialogue and conversation with participant
-
colleagues. As 
I mentioned 
previously in this chapte
r, I was mindful of the impact 
of my presence and status as a colleague a
nd new AP on my interpretations
 
as 
well as on my language use, particularly with 
regard to 
educational jargon that 
might hamper
 
clarity.
 
Methods of Data Collection
 
The methods of data
 
collection that I drew on to investigate ways that APs 
negotiate identities as they become educational leaders included interviewing 
educators and recording our conversations, collecting documents as sources of 
information, and maintaining a journal.
 
By c
onducting a qualitative interview, I aimed to study 

the attitudes, 
beliefs, and experiences of individuals

 
(Carspecken, 1996
, p.
 
38). According to 
Carspecken, the goal of the qualitative interview is to 
encourage the 
participants 
to describe events 
in wh
ich 
they remember taking part
, elicit
 
their recollection
s
 
of 
incidents and specific act
ion situations, and then 
articulate
 
their interpretations. 
For all interviews I used a narrative interview method, which is an approach that 
draws on the biographical
-
in
terpretive method and the autobiographical narrative 
interview (Hollway & Jefferson, 2000). Hollway and Jefferson pointed out that 
the information from these narratives originates 
in 
the free association of the 
participant and is not always under the contr
ol of the interviewer. The free
-
association process invites participants to self
-
select experiences, 
which thereby 
60
 
 
allows
 
researchers to gain access to the events that they determine to be the most 
significant and relevant. The principles that guide this m
ethod include 
the use of 
open
-
ended questions, 
the avoidance of 

why

 
questions, follow
-
up on themes 
by 
using the narrative order and phrases of th
e interviewee, and acknowledgement
 
that the stories that the interviewer elicits are choices that the storyte
ller makes. I 
noted 
Hollway and Jefferson

s emphasis on 
the 
importance of eliciting stories 
intact from 
the 
participants, with the intention of drawing out concrete details to 
explore certain experiences to the fullest.
 
I developed a structural framework 
t
o gather
 
data that provided a focus for 
analysis and interpretation (see Appendix
 
A). This framework guided the 
interview discussions, the flow of the interpretation of the interviews, and the 
analysis. My interview questions focused primarily on four area
s 
to investigate
 
the experiences of new APs: preparation for the administrative role; the impact of 
becoming an AP on relationships with family, colleagues, and students; 
conceptions of leadership; and issues of conflict in forming AP identities. I asked 
t
he district leaders in my study to describe their roles within their respective 
districts, their role
s
 
in leadership formation and training, and their conceptions of 
leadership.
 
Although I had planned 
two interviews (see Appendixes
 
A and B
 
for 
sample inter
view questions), I did not rule out the possibility of a third should 
information be lacking. The second interview with the APs took place wit
hin two 
months of the first one, o
nce I had gained a perspective on the first interview and 
had 

a reading of the 
person that [was] sensitive to all the details offered

 
61
 
 
(Hollway & Jefferson, 2000
, p.
 
43). The purpose of the second interview was to 
explore themes that had e
merged and to fill in gaps. 
In the transcripts I assigned 
pseudonyms to the participants and the
ir institutions. I typed the transcripts 
myself for ease of reading, notation, and coding.
 
The main
 
data phase began in March 2008, and 
all 
of the 
interviews 
took 
place within four months of that time. I interviewed the two district
-
level 
participants once
 
and the three AP participants twice, each approximately three 
weeks apart
, and
 
I arranged 
for 
one supplementary interview. 
The 
interviews were 
no longer than one hour in duration, and 
I
 
conducted 
them 
on an individual basis 
either at the school site or at
 
a location mutually convenient to me and the 
participants. I was the sole transcriptionist of these tape
-
recorded interviews, and 
all participants gave their informed consent to use the data that they generated in 
this research study. I performed member c
hecks with all participants to 
ensure 
the 
accuracy and adequacy of our conversations.
 
The second strategy that I used to collect information was to review 
documents that were germane to 
the identification of
 
certain perspectives
 
and
 
discourses in each of t
he school boards. These documents included policies 
on 
the 
role of the 
AP
 
as well as the evaluation criteria for administrators. I also reviewed 
documents from the Ministry of Ed
ucation that included the newly 
developed 
prov
incial standards for principals;
 
this document will influence the structure of 
future leadership programs and evaluation documents. Finally, I recorded in a 
journal
 
my
 
impressions and reflections after each interv
iew and transcription
 
and 
referred to these notes as required.
 
62
 
 
Data Analysi
s Procedures
 
 
The interview questions. 
The interview questions provided information 
on 
the 
participants

 
backgrounds, their understanding of leadership and their role, 
and the impact of becoming an AP on their personal and professional lives. 
The 
p
articipa
nt
s

 
responses formed part of my interpretation of the interview data, in 
which I also described my impressions of each of the participants, at times 
inferring qualities and attitudes from their body language and voice tone. The 
interpretation also include
d the perspective
s
 
of the participants

 
respective school 
districts. As well, I developed an interpretive summary that was guided by the 
following questions:
 
1.
 
How did the district and the AP(s) understand conceptions of 
leadership? Where did their unders
tandings intersect? Diverge?
 
2.
 
How did the district and the AP(s) understand what the role of the AP 
is and how a teacher might best prepare for it as he or she moves from 
teaching to leading?
 
As 
I 
collected, transcribed, and reflected upon
 
the
 
interview 
data, 
I 
engaged in a preliminary analysis, and at several junctures restated and clarified 
the research question and theoretical perspective on identity.
 
Coding the data.
 
One of my first goals in coding and analyzing the 
transcripts from the interviews and
 
the various sources of information was to 
understand
 
the discursive practices of leadership that circulate in particular school 
districts. Following Carspecken

s
 
(2001)
 
advice
, 
I intended
 
to identify certain 
words 
that the 
participants 
used 
and to attend 
to the semantic structures that 
63
 
 
position people within power relationships. Other useful strategies were to look 
for contrasts 
between 
and similarities to other terms that worked together
 
and
 
to 
examine pragmatic structures such as roles, patterns, and act
ivities (Carspecken, 
2001). I developed three questions to guide this process: 
(a)
 
What are APs

 
understandings of what leadership is
?
 
(b)
 
What 
is the district

s understanding of
 
what makes an effective leader?
 
and 
(c)
 
What 
power structures are in operatio
n? 
Working across the interviews numerous times, I identified categories, patterns, 
and themes that 
are 
part of particular discursive leadership practices and that 
emerged as authoritative discourses.
 
A second goal was to use a coding procedure with the in
terview data to 
answer and analyze the question 

What 
does learning to lead 
do
 
to an educator?

 
I 
colour
-
coded the interview sheets of each AP participant
,
 
cut into strips all of 
their speech units, 
and sorted and organized
 
their experiences of
 
becoming 
ed
ucational leader
s
. 
I organized t
he themes that emerged from this process into 
six categories that described 
the 
challenges and conflicts that 
the 
new APs 
encountered during their transition from
 
teaching to a leadership role, and I 
combined s
ome of the the
mes to better highlight their contradictory natures. 
These themes comprise
d
 
the personally persuasive discourses of 
the 
participants
;
 
they
 
included
 
the following: 
(a)
 
Becoming 
a new 
AP
 
both demands the AP

s 
compliance with existing authority, policies, and
 
practices 
and
 
gives 
the AP the 
power and authority to act; 
(b)
 
taking on the AP role problematizes 
and
 
opens up 
understandings of educational leadership; 
(c)
 
becoming a new AP both hampers 
and
 
opens up opportunities 
to 
develop educational leadership skill
s and 
64
 
 
competencies; 
(d)
 
the transition from teaching to leading challenges 
and 
affirms 
the AP

s beliefs and assumptions about teaching and learning; 
(e)
 
a beginning AP 
experiences changes and enhancements to school
-
based relationships; 
and 
(f)
 
assuming the
 
role of AP both problematizes 
and
 
opens up opportunities for 
change and growth. I sought feedback on the accuracy and adequacy of these 
findings from two colleague administrators in the educational community and 
revised 
them 
as necessary.
 
Finally, 
I combi
ned 
the authoritative discourses that emerged and the 
personally persuasive discourses of 
the 
participants to develop three themes that 
I 
analyze
 
in 
c
hapter 
six
. Each theme is central to the negotiation of AP identity:
 
1.
 
Various authoritative discourses o
f leadership are circulating in 
training programs for aspiring leaders (i.e.
,
 
top
-
down management, 
collaborati
ve leadership, neo
li
beral business practices). They
 
are in 
conflict 
not only 
with one another, but also with some internally 
persuasive discourses
 
of aspiring leaders in a Catholic school system 
(i.e.
,
 
ethic of care, social justice). How do the participants experience 
and negotiate these conflicting discourses?
 
2.
 
First
-
year AP
s are required to negotiate
 
among personally persuasive 
discourses of com
munity, collegial relationships, and institutional 
expectations of leadership. How do the participants experience the 
challenges and affirmations 
of 
these deeply held values and traditional 
institutional demands of administration?
 
65
 
 
3.
 
Becoming a new 
AP
 
dema
nds the AP

s compliance with 
both the 
existing authoritative discourses of leadership responsibilities, district 
policies, and practices
 
and
 
the expectation that educational leaders will 
exercise autonomous power and authority. How do the participants 
nego
tiate this tension between these role expec
tations and autonomous 
decision 
making?
 
Ethics
 
 
Because this study involved the participation of human subjects, I was 
cognizant of issues of power and privilege and the need to consider any potential 
ethical prob
lems beyond common, everyday risk. I therefore addressed the ethical 
considerations by submitting an ethics application form in adherence with the 
ethical guidelines of the Faculties of Education and Extension and the Augustana 
Research Ethics Board at the
 
University of Alberta.
 
I explained the purpose and nature of my research to all 
of the 
participants 
individually, either in person or by telephone, and sent them a written letter and 
consent form 
that described
 
the research study in m
ore detail and clearl
y outlined
 
the
ir
 
right to opt out without penalty should they choose
 
to do so
. I reminded the 
participants of their rights at the beginning and end of each interview in the event 
that their original intentions had changed. No participants chose to opt out 
of this 
research study. With respect to 
the 
participants from the two participating school 
jurisdictions, I have no authority over hiring, eva
luation, transfer, or promotion;
 
m
y relationship is solely as a colleague and scholar. With respect to privacy, 
an
onymity, and confidentiality issues, I cannot guarantee 
the 
participants

 
66
 
 
anonymity, but 
I have made 
every effort to ensure confidentiality 
by using 
pseudonyms to protect 
their 
identities. I also changed the names of all schools and 
school districts, as re
flected in the transcripts and documents 
that I have 
mentioned in this research. I 
have 
stored the original transcripts and all original 
data in a locked drawer in my home and will keep them for a period of five years 
after the completion of this study. I 
did not involve research assistants, 
transcriptionists, interpreters, and/or other personnel to carry out any research 
tasks.
 
Although I do not anticipate any threat or harm to the participants, I 
believe that some risk is involved in terms of trust in eng
aging in an open 
dialogue about actions and feelings; in other words, the participants may have felt 
or now feel vulnerable. From the onset and during the interviews, I anticipated 
building a professional and friendly relationship with the participants by 
being 
empathic, showing vulnerability myself, withholding judgment, and 
offering 
ongoing support. In the event that I encounter any of the research participants 
after I have completed this research, I hope to be attentive to any lingering effects, 
positive
 
or negative, on the participants themselves and to 
demonstrate 
increased 
thoughtfulness and tact when we meet.
 
Limitations
 
This study was restricted to two school districts in one area, in one 
province in Canada. The findings in this study are not general
izable to all junior 
high schools
,
 
nor are they generalizable to the experiences of other new APs, but 
67
 
 
they might be transferable to other school situations and settings. The reader will 
be in the best position to determine 
their transferability.
 
In terms 
of limitations related to sampling, during the year that 
I 
conducted the 
interviews and gathered 
the data 
within the consenting school 
boards, there were only three new APs in junior high school
,
 
and although 
they 
all 
agreed to participate, the sample is s
mall. A third limitation is with respect to the 
data procedures
. 
No 
observations were deemed necessary for two reasons
:
 
My 
research question was centered on identity formation more than on role (which is 
the observable part)
,
 
and
 
because I am in 
an AP 
posi
tion myself, I was familiar 
with the context of the research, the nature of the work, and the world of 
educational administration.
 
 
In this chapter I explained how a
n 
ethnographic approach supported 
my 
research on how new 
AP
s negotiate authoritative and pe
rsonally persuasive 
discourses to fashion their identities as leaders. I described the
 
research design 
and data
-
analysis procedures, which 
included 
selecting
 
the 
participants and texts 
on educational leadership from two Catholic school districts, literatur
e on 
educational leadership, 
and documents from 
the province

s Ministry of Education, 
as well as 
coding 
the 
data and developing themes. Finally, I discussed 
the 
ethical 
considerations related to human participants and 
the 
poss
ible limitations of this 
study
.
 
 
In chapters four and five I report the findings 
from 
the data collection 
from 
two Catholic school districts and three first
-
year 
AP
s. 
I also analyze 
l
eadership training, the structure of the experience of new 
AP
s
, and conceptions 
68
 
 
of leadership from the 
per
spective of the school district
 
and 
analyze the 
preparation and induction into the administrative role from the perspectives of the 
new 
AP
s.
 
69
 
 
CHAPTER FOUR:
 
BECOMING AN ASSISTANT PRINCIPAL IN
 
MISSION CATHOLIC SCHOOL DISTRICT
 
 
In the next two chapters I r
eport t
he findings 
from 
the data from two 
Catholic school districts and three first
-
year 
AP
s for my 
in
vestigation of
 
how new 
AP
s fashion their educational leadership identities in relation to persuasiv
e and 
authoritative discourses. 
In this chapter I begin
 
with the structural framework that 
I 
used to explore the formation of 
AP
 
identities, followed by 
the findings from 
MCSD
, a medium
-
sized rural district in Western Canada, 
which 
describe 
leadership training, the structure of the experience of new 
AP
s
, and 
t
he 
conceptions of leadership from the perspective of the school district. 
Last, I 
describe the 
preparation 
for 
and induction into the administrative role from the 
perspective of Brian
, a first
-
year AP
 
who is a new educational leader 
in 
this 
district.
 
I use
d a pseudonym for both Brian and his school district 
to maintain 
their anonymity
.
 
Structural Framework to Investigate the Formation
 
of Assistant Principal Identities
 
 
This research is part of my own journey and experience in becoming an 
AP
. Because of my o
wn role as a new AP, my interactions and relationship
s
 
with 
the 
participants 
were 
more collegial than academic. Our conversations took place 
in an atmosphere of engagement and genuine mutual interest within a context of 
shared stories and recollections. 
Ma
ny times 
I held back my own version of a 
similar situation
,
 
and 
many 
times an exchange of experiences 
would have 
70
 
 
enhanced the discussion. The APs were com
fortable with the prospect of my
 
recording two one
-
hour conversations in their school offices after sc
hool hours. I 
met with the district leaders in their offices at their respective school boards for a 
one
-
hour interview
,
 
also outside of school hours. At the beginning of each of the 
conversations with 
the 
participants, we establish
ed
 
a 
rapport and camarad
erie
,
 
and 
this eased any 
tension
. In many ways the contiguous nature of the study

I was
 
both a participant and 
the researcher

changed the way that I 
assumed 
the role of 
AP. As I asked questions of 
the 
participants and listened to their responses, our 
conve
rsations directly influenced my future actions as an educational 
administrator. Their collective experiences became valuable information for me as 
I continued to learn the role.
 
The structural framework that I used 
to gather
 
data 
created 
a focus for 
analys
is and interpretation. I used this framework to guide the interview 
discussions and the flow of 
my 
interpretation of the interviews with new APs. 
I 
asked the d
istrict leaders in my study to describe their roles within their respective 
districts, their role
 
in the leadership formation and training of prospective and new 
APs, and their conceptions of leadership
 
to ascertain the districts

 
perspectives. In 
the following section I describe in detail four topics 
with regard to 
h
ow teachers 
form AP identities 
by 
using my own experience as a new AP to provide a context 
for 
the interpretation of 
these topics. The four topics are 
(a)
 
preparation for the 
administrative role; 
(b)
 
the impact of becoming an AP on relationships with 
family, colleagues, and students; 
(c)
 
c
onceptions of leadership; and 
(d)
 
issues of 
conflict in forming AP identities.

Preparation for the Administrative Role
 
 
The c
ircumstances and events that prepare a teacher for a school
-
based 
administrative role vary between districts and from person to per
son. Through 
interview questions
,
 
I attempted to draw out stories of formal and informal 
preparation in the development of leadership skills and understandings. My own 
transition from teacher to leader was both an easy and a difficult process, which I 
ackn
owledge is appropriately ambiguous, as is the nature of the AP role. My six 
years as a curriculum consultant 
gave 
me a distinct advantage over teacher 
colleagues 
who were 
assuming 
school
-
based administrative position
s
 
for the first 
time. As a consultant, I
 
had developed a broader perspective of my own school 
district and how it functioned, 
formed 
professional relationships with many 
district personnel, strengthened my communication and presentation skills, 
deepened my understanding of curriculum and assessm
ent practices, served on 
provincial committees, and was exposed to a wide variety of leadership styles in 
many schools and other educational venues. I attended my district

s leadership 
formation program in 2006
-
2007, which served primarily as an introducti
on to 
the 
literature on school culture, professional learning communities, and teacher 
leadership.
 
My first placement as an AP was in a sizable 
K
-
9
 
school that partnered me 
with two very experienced administrators: a second AP and a principal. As a 
result,
 
the tasks that 
two normally share
 
were spread among three administrators, 
which was exceedingly helpful 
to 
my initiation into leadership. However, I soon 
learned that what I thought I knew about the role and about leadership did not 
72
 
 
quite match the realit
y of being in an AP position. The skills that I had developed 
were indeed helpful
,
 
but they were potentially superfluous or inadequate. I walked 
into a predetermined role that had been in place and 
into which 
I was expected to 
step
, no matter my skill 
set.
 
It was assumed
,
 
nevertheless
,
 
that I was up to the 
many managerial tasks, coaching duties, organizational needs, and assortment of 
requests 
from 
the school community. I became adept 
at 
guessing what needed to 
be done and was frequently guided by the respo
nses of others.
 
Impact of Becoming an Assistant Principal on Relationships
 
 
I asked my AP participants questions about the impact of learning to lead 
on their personal and professional relationships to consider how they reconcile
d
 
newfound authority and de
al
t
 
with 

buy
-
in

 
in
to their new role. For me, parent, 
student, and teacher expectations were apparent at the onset of the school year, 
although the responsibilities of the AP were slow to emerge and not clearly set 
out. 
Members 
of the school community oft
en wanted and expected immediate 
answers to their many questions. I was at times unsettled by requests to speak to 
the nuances of the school

s admission policy or by my ignorance of commonplace 
school information such as bus schedules, student movement, su
pervision 
schedules, timetabling

things that 
I 
would normally 
pick
 
up through experience, 
but 
that 
needed to be communicated in 
a 
timely
 
manner
.
 
A second impact 
of 
learning to lead was my loss as a teacher of the 
physical space of a classroom to serve as a
 
home base 
in which 
to keep resources 
and display student work and visual pedagogical aids. I was assigned to teach two 
classes of social studies to 
Grade
 
7 students in a home economics laboratory that 
73
 
 
was organized around four very large tables. Twenty
-
ei
ght students were crowded 
into a space 
that 
was at times distracting 
because of 
the array of forgotten sewing 
needles or the aroma of freshly baked muffins. 
I was not accustomed to t
his 
classroom ambiance, but it was the only room that could accommodate my
 
teaching schedule.
 
 
It is difficult to gauge the impact of becoming an AP on my relationship 
with members of my family; the time became blurred with the additional 
commitment of academic pursuits. However, I 
had 
less time overall with my 
spouse and especi
ally with my aging parents; I was more likely to be doing 
homework alongside my 
three university
-
aged children.
 
 
More visible was the impact on my professional life as a new 
administrator. My relationships with a handful of teachers whom I knew at the 
scho
ol had already been established to some extent through my consultant role. I 
had presented professional development sessions to staff and parents at this 
school on several occasions over the years. Some staff assumed that this was not 
my first assignment a
s an AP and were therefore surprised at a certain level of 
doubt or hesitation that I occasionally displayed 
to 
what they perceived were 
simple requests and expectations.
 
Conceptions of Leadership
 
To elicit from new APs their understandings of leadership, 
I asked them to 
describe their images of leadership at its best and its worst, as well as to articulate 
their own leadership style and to create a metaphor of leadership that reflected 
their approach. Yukl (2002) 
noted 
that 

researchers usually define lead
ership 
74
 
 
according to their individual perspectives and the aspects of the phenomenon of 
most interest to them

 
(p.
 
2)
,
 
and I anticipated that 
the 
research participants would 
do the same.
 
Throughout my first year as an AP, I struggled with the many 
understan
dings of leadership that emerge in this role, whether they originate
d
 
from my own subjective experience or from the perspective
s
 
and expectations of 
others. I was surprised by both the tension and the tentativeness that arose in me 
when 
I was 
making certai
n decisions. I wanted to be perceived as fair, reasonable, 
capable, and strong
;
 
yet I often found myself wondering what actions actually led 
to this perception. What is a leader

s appropriate response? Was I being too harsh, 
too lenient, too vulnerable, or
 
perhaps not creative enough? 
In an attempt to gain 
an acceptable solution, 
I found myself engaged in a constant negotiation to ensure 
that the dignity of 
everyone 
involved 
in 
the issue remained intact
; 
of course, a 
happy outcome was not always the end res
ult. My co
-
administrators were 
instrumental in both advising 
me on 
and debriefing these situations. Together, we 
worked within a shared leadership model
,
 
because my current principal places a 
high value on building 
the 
leadership capacity 
of 
all staff and 
students. He 
exemplifies a type of leadership in which relationships are most important
,
 
and he 
maintains that all decisions must, in some way, elevate the situation.
 
Another understanding of leadership that gave me pause was the 
concatenation of leading a
nd managing. Did the distinction really matter? Were 
managerial tasks 
not 
characteristic of the leader role 
according to 
my district

s 
administrator evaluation document? As educators, do we not laud the business 
75
 
 
literature on leadership and attempt to emul
ate its organizational structures? But 
the more I learned from studying leadership in university coursework, the more I 
recognized just how fragile and confusing our shared understandings of leadership
 
were
. How might school districts and other APs make se
nse of this?
 
Issues of Conflict in Forming Assistant Principal Identities
 
In the process of becoming new AP
s
, those 
who are 
learning to lead are 
shaped by multiple and complex factors, such as discursive practices of leadership 
and other people

s overfamil
iarity with the AP role. Parents, teachers, studen
ts, 
secretaries, and custodians

all of these others play a role opposite an 
administrator based on their years of observation
,
 
and they create conditions and 
expectations that 
might 
not be comfortable for t
he new AP. Hartzell 
et
 
al
. 
(1994) 
reminded us that very few teachers, for example (as part of those 

others

)
,
 
get a 
close look at the school

s administrative operation 
or 
are always aware of the 
complexity of the work involved when they become APs. They d
evelop ideas of 
what the role is and how 
the new AP might structure 
relations of power
,
 
because 
the stable identity of the person in the role is often assumed. Britzman (2003) 
pointed out that teacher
s

 
identities become overpopulated with superficial 
know
ledge about the role and 
that gender

female and male identities

also 
impacts 
the 
expectations of the role. I believe that a similar tension also works to 
construct the new AP.
 
For me, conflicts between my identity as an AP and the AP role seemed at 
times q
uite manageable, and then insurmountable. My knowledge of curriculum 
and assessment practices, for example, from
 
my former role as a consultant
 
76
 
 
enhanced my effectiveness as an instructional leader. I was comfortable engaging 
in conversations about pedagogy
 
with teachers and was not so uneasy about the 
prospect of supervising teacher practice. On the other hand, my relationship
s
 
with 
teachers 
were 
not always smooth. During the first reporting period in November, 
the three administrators in my school shared t
he task of 
giving teachers 
written 
feedback on a draft copy of their report cards. One of the 

seasoned

 
male 
teachers assigned to me angrily entered my office the next day. He claimed that I 
had insulted his integrity and professionalism by questioning th
e grades of 

insufficient achievement

 
that he had given to certain students and by writing 
observations that, in his opinion, distinctly lacked positive feedback. He claimed 
that none of his previous administrators had ever contested any aspect of his 
rep
ort cards. This teacher was forceful and passionate in his indignation, and after 
calming him down with an explanation of my rationale, I burst into tears. I cannot 
say 
whether 
I was embarrassed or hurt by his accusation, but I was
 
completely
 
unprepared fo
r such a challenge to my authority. My two male administrative 
colleagues, in a later discussion, suggested that I was the victim of a bullying 
tactic, perhaps because I am female and 

smaller.

 
My relationship with this 
teacher, although guarded after thi
s event, remained courteous and professional.
 
Format for Presenting the Interview Data
 
In chapters four and five I present my 
interpretation of 
my 
conversations 
with my research participants as pairings of perspectives from two Catholic 
school districts. E
ach pairing comprises the point of view of the district and the 
perspective of one or two new APs from the same school district. This approach 
77
 
 
helped me to establish a context of leadership for new AP
s
 
because it directly 
linked the discursive leadership p
ractices 
of 
the district with the experiences and 
understandings of th
e new AP. The format that I use
 
to present the interview data 
from the AP participants 
includes 
descriptive passages and the participants

 
own 
words. 
Because t
his research is integ
rally 
tied to AP subjectivities, 
it was my 
intention to 
retain 
as close
ly
 
as possible 
the individual participants

 
original 
language 
and 
their intended meaning by conducting member checks.
 
In this chapter I describe the 
MCSD
 
and 
its 
perspective
 
on the transition
 
from teacher
 
to administrative leader
, followed by the story of Brian, a school 
administrator who is a new AP in the 
MCSD
.
 
School District

Perspective on Becoming an Assistant Principal
 
At the time of this research

700 students in 
18 
schools and

It was the third largest Catholic school district 
in the province and was governed by seven elected school trustees, whose 
mandate was to ensure t
hat 
the district

s policies and practices reflected 
Catholic 
principles and values. The trustees acted in conjunction with the superintendent of 
MCSD, who worked with a
 
deputy superintendent and an assistant superintendent 
re
sponsible for Learning Services
;
 
two directors, one of Student Services and t

deputy superintendent position included responsibility for two 
departments, Leadership Services and Human Resources, 
a
nd the
 
role involved 
guiding the development of leadership training programs and placing and 
evaluating school

based administr
ative leaders. In this capacity
 
the 
d
eputy 
s
uperintendent was also responsible for 
identifying 
teachers with 
the 
potential for 
AP 
positions and worked with APs 
who were 
interested in becoming principals.
 
MCSD

s 
mission statement 
emphasizes
 
the importance of 
giving students 
quality learning opportunities through 

Christ
-
cent
e
red programs rooted in 
Catholic principles.

 
Staff members 
a
re expected to model morals and core 
values, prayer, respect, and high expectations to meet the district twin goals of 
forming 

good people

 
and 
attaining 
academic excellence. MCSD was responsive 
to the current practice of providing choice to students and 
parents. On 
its Web site 
it advertises
 
a variety of special programs 
designed 
to meet the needs of 
its many 
students; these include
 
a cyber school, sports academies, arts programs, 
International Baccalaureate programs, and home schooling.
 
Also on the MCSD 
Web site are 
the yearly reports on jurisdiction 
performance that the Ministry of Education
 
mandated
: the 

Three
-
Year Education 
Plan

 
and the 

Annual Education Results Reports

 
(AERR
s
), both measures that 
aim
 
to ensure that school districts 
a
re accountable 
for their results and their use of 
resources to provide quality programming and address areas 
for 
improvement. 
The 

Three
-
Year Education Plan

 
is a report that outlines 
the
 
district

s goals 
(aligned with the goals of the province) over three years, strateg
ies for 
improvement
,
 
and a budget. The AERR gauges 
the
 
district

s progress toward 
79
 
 
achieving the goals and 
the 
outcomes of 
its 

Three
-
Year Educat
ion Plan.

 
Both 
reports involve the
 
district

s review of any local measures as well as a summary 
of accountabili
ty measures that 
the ministry 
sends
 
annually to each school district. 
This 
a
ccountability

district 
surveys conducted earlier 
in the school year that 
the ministry coordinates
 
for school staff

students in 
Grades
 
4, 7, and 10
;
 
and their parents to determine 
their 
levels of satisfaction with 
their school and school district with respect to goals that 
the ministry has 
set out. 
The

the
 
school district

s achievement 
on provincial exams, 
its
 
diploma participation rate, and the percentage of students 
eligible for a provincial scholarship. Reported are the school district

The 
2007
-
2008 
AERR
 
contained 
messages 
from the 
MCSD

s 
Board of 
Trustees and superintendent 
about the benefits of 
Catholic education
 
such as 
opportunities for students to perform service projects and develop 
further 
spiritually
, as well as 
the district

s
 
highlights, goals, future challenges, and 
financial results and a report on 
its 
capital and facilities. The goals a
nd outcomes 
that MCSD developed were clearly connected to the data on the district in the 
accountability report
. MCSD

s goal for 

the education system to meet the needs 
of all students, society, and the economy

 
is 
aligned with the provincial goal 
of 
high
-
quality learning opportunities for all staff and students. The goal 
in the 
80
 
 
AERR
 
was paired with a survey question 
designed to determine
 
the extent to 
which parents and students were satisfied with the overall quality of basic 
education 
in the 
MCSD. The 
AER
R described the 
strategy to manage this 
outcome 
as 
an action research project 
that involved 
research from Gallup 
University and 
was 
based on 
the 
work 
of 
Dr. Gary Gordon to build engaged 
schools. The district had already begun to implement a staff selection
 
process for 
both instructional staff and administrators that enabled the human resources 
department 

to select and interview the most talented people to work with 
students.

 
It 
also incorporated a districtwide 
Gallup 
survey aimed at measuring 
critical are
as of 
the 
schoo
l climate that directly affect
 
teacher engagement. After 
having used this new process for a 
year, the district was confident that 
it 
was 

proving to be reliable and was yielding positive results.

 
A second district goal that supported the sa
me provincial goal was 
to 
ensure 
that MCSD 
staff 

experience passion, purpose and conviction.

 
This goal 
was developed in conjunction with a survey question 
designed to measure
 
the 
extent to which te
achers were satisfied with staff morale in 
the 
schools.
 
T
he 
strategy identified to manage teacher satisfaction 
was to find a way to 
fully 
engage staff members
 
in their work so that they 
can 
provide 

students with the 
highest degree of service and educational expertise.

 
MCSD once again drew on 
research from Gall
up University to develop what 
it 
called 

a strength
-
based 
organization

 
(
the 
school) to generate in staff more passion 
for 
and fulfillment 
from 
the
ir
 
work. According to a district leader, the underlying theoretical 
approaches included in the Gallup researc
h were also 

applied to the district

s 
81
 
 
negotiations process, its professional development model, and to human resources 
practices for selection and hiring of professional staff.

 
MCSD

s faith identity as 
a Catholic district was also an integral part of thi
s formative process
,
 
which the 
district 
contended was further supported by the strength
-
based professional 
development included in the Gallup approach. 
Both of the strategies described 
above were integral components of MCSD

s practice in shaping leadership
 
training and professional development.
 
Leadership Training in the School District
 
Before the 2007
-
2008 school year, MCSD 
approached the 
recruit
ment of
 
teachers into administrative positions 
by offering
 
a leadership development 
program 
to answer
 
a key ques
tion about a vocational call to administrative 
leadership. 
Vocation
 
suggests that a person respond
s
 
to a spiritual summoning to 
perform a type of special work or function with a particular set of values and, in 
the case of MCSD, 
Catholic
 
values. More than 
50 teachers from this Catholic 
district took up the call over a period of four years to participate in a program that 
included discussion on the different meanings of leadership
 
and
 
the district

s
 
criteria 
for leader
s
, 
as well as 
a focus on what individual
 
teachers had to offer the 
district. Interested teachers met approximately seven times from January through 
December, culminating at year end with an opportunity to apply the following 
January for an administrative
-
based appointment for the next school yea
r. The 
leadership program

s topics of discussion were shared monthly with principals to 
encourage teache
r
-
leader/
administrator conversations about leadership at the 
school level. Part of the formation and training program also included one or two 
82
 
 
opportun
ities
 
for the teacher leaders to job
-
shadow a principal in a school at a 
different level. The district be
lieves that job shadowing helps
 
teachers to 
gain a 
visual
 
understand
ing and 
a sense of the school culture and 
is 
an opportunity to 
encounter different 
leadership perspective
s
, usually at a level unfamiliar to the 
teacher. T
he t
eachers were assigned books and articles to read on topics such as 
Catholic leadership and how to develop more effective communication skills. As 
a culminating activity, 
the 
teache
rs 
responded
 
to the question 

Am I called to 
administrative leadership?

 
in writing.
 
Foundation of leadership programs. 
A
 
team of MCSD administrators 
who served on a district
-
level committee 
that the deputy superintendent 
established developed 
t
he curricul
um for the district leadership program
.
 
This 
committee operated as a focus group that 
offered 
advice and
 
consultation on this
 
and other leadership development programs. The MCSD approach was to focus 
professional development for prospective administrators 
on a document called the 

Role of the Principal for School Administrator Evaluation.

 
This document 
was 
the basis for school
-
site administrator evaluation and the foundation for the 
development of the district

s leadership training programs. The district h
ad 
designed 
the role of the principal around cultural, instructional, and managerial/
organizational leadership perspectives. In addition to these understandings of 
leadership, the 

Role of the Principal

 
document also outlined the desirable 
personal and professional attributes of accomplished school administrator
s
, as 
well as 
their 
skill
s
 
in the area of interpersonal relationships (see Appendix C). 
Each role description in the 

Role of the Principal

 
document was exemplified by 
83
 
 
a detailed list of 
possible 
specific responsibilities for an administrator. However, 
an 
unexpected quality that M
CSD considered worthwhile to evaluate was part of 
the skill set for the development of interpersonal relationships. 
To 
develop 
positive (interpersonal) relations with stakeholders, principal
s
 
were 
assessed on 
how well 
they 
established partnerships with com
munity agencies and 
organizations within the school community, on how well 
they 
established 
procedures for effective communication, and
,
 
surprisingly, on 
their 
propensity for 
entrepreneurship. 
Entrepreneur
 
is 
first and 
foremost a term associated with 
busin
ess

a person 
who organizes and manages a business with considerable 
initiative and risk. How and for what purposes did entrepreneurship become a 
desirable skill for a school principal 
in the 
MCSD? Whatever the reasons, this 
mindset 
might 
have been a contri
buting factor 
in 
the district

s recent shift in 
its 
approach to leadership formation.
 
A new approach to leadership formation. 
To maximize 
its 
limited 
resources to interview the 

best

 
people for teaching and administrative positions, 
MCSD partnered with an
 
organization that 
used 
a preliminary assessment tool 
to 
screen
 
applicants to the school district based on a ranking system. 
In 
2007
 
the 
district purchased online tools and services from the educational end of the Gallup 
Organization
. 
I 
have 
described the 
rationale for this partnership with Gallup 
elsewhere in this chapter as part of the strategies that MCSD devised to 
offer 
all 
staff in the district
 
h
igh
-
quality learning opportunities.
 
Gallup 
Consulting 
Education Practice 
(
Gallup, Inc.
,
 
2009
b
) 
is 
an 
Americ
an 
Web
-
based prescreening tool that identifies potential administrative 
84
 
 
candidates
. The
 
strategy involves 
measuring
 
talent 
by 
using an assessment tool 
called 
PrincipalInsight
.

 
Gallup
, 
Inc.
 
(2009d
) described
 
talents as naturally 
existing 

recurring pattern
s of thought, feeling, or behavior that can be 
productively applied

 
(p.
 
184) by a person. MCSD believes
 
that the research upon 
which this assessment 
wa
s based was solid
 
with regard to
 
what the best principals 
do, not only because it was based on Gallup

s 
claim that 
the results 
are consistent 
with 
principal applicant
s

 
responses, but 
also 
because it reflected 
the 
performance 
expectations that the district itself identified as part of the role of the principal.
 
As well, Ga
llup 
Consulting 
Education Practice 
(
Gallup, Inc., 
2009
b
)
 
offers 
TeacherInsight
, which is also a talent indicator 
for 
teacher
s
. The district 
considered this a valuable tool, 
like 
its predecessor from the Stanford Research 
Institute (SRI). According to one of MCSD

s leaders, both of these tool
s were 
easy to use and highly predictable for the hiring of staff.
 
MCSD

s decision to buy 
services from Gallup had its roots 
partially 
in the religious work of a Catholic 
educator 
that 
underpinned the district

s desire to identify 
its 
staff

s God
-
given 
tal
ents and gifts as part of the ministry of Catholic education. The Gallup 
program

s
 
approach to identifying talents seemin
gly fit the values, core
 
mission
,
 
and vision of the school district because 
the 
leaders moved towards finding and 
working with their 
ow
n
 
strengths.
 
 
For 
MCSD 
teachers who were interested in leadership formation, the 
procedure 
for 
apply
ing
 
to the district began with the completion
 
of an online 
assessment using 
PrincipalInsight
 
from Gallup
, 
Inc.
 
(2009
b
)
. 
Although the 
d
eputy 
s
uperintendent r
eviewed all applicants in the school district who completed a 
85
 
 
PrincipalInsight
 
assessment, he or she focused primarily on the names at the top 
of the list based on a ranking of the results and then worked down the list to 
schedule intervi
ews. The district 
believes
 
that 
at times it 
is 
somewhat more 
difficult for a large panel of interviewers wit
h different ideas 
on 
talent
 
to 
accurately assess the potential of a candidate
 
and that 
the 
PrincipalInsight
 
talent 
indicator 
would 
eliminate this ambiguity. The quest
ions from the district

s 
administrative application 
form 
were then aligned 
with 
the behaviour descriptive 
interview approach, because these questions also have a high level of 
predictability 
of 
future behaviours.
 
After the interview process 
the deputy supe
rintendent met with each 
of the 
applicants and debriefed the interview and the assessment. The purpose was 
to 
have 
someone at the district level describe to 
each 
applicant what the panel had 
learned about him or her and then to suggest what the applicant m
ight do 
with 
this 
new information. The 
deputy superintendent focused on the identified talents 
and 
use
d
 
this information from the Gallup assessment to 
help 
the teacher, especially in 
the event that the teacher

s application for a school
-
based administrativ
e position 
was unsuccessful.
 
According to MCSD, in addition to 
PrincipalInsight
,
 
StrengthFinder
 
was 
also a 
useful component of the Gallup
, 
Inc.
 
(
2009
a
)
 
program. 
StrengthFinder
 
is an 
online tool that 
results in 
a personal assessment of an individual

s top 
f
ive 
strengths. Gallup
,
 
Inc. 
(2009d)
 
described
 
strength
 
as 

the ability to provide 
consistent, near
-
perfect performance in a specific task [but that] must be 
developed and are the product that results when one

s talents are refined with 
86
 
 
acquired skills and 
knowledge

 
(p.
 
184). All current administrators in the district 
were required to access this tool to complete a questionnaire
,
 
and 
the senior 
administration then 
analyzed 
the
 
results. Some examples of what might 
contribute 
to 
a person

s individual strength
s were being a 

learner

 
or an 

arranger

 
and 

having great empathy.

 
The district encouraged teachers and administrators to 
spend their time on their top strengths while they did their work and to downplay 
any character weaknesses.
 
Developing an administr
ative team. 
A benefit of identifying strengths, 
according to the district, 
was 
that this process 
was 
an integral component of 
planning how 
to match 
administrative team members
. MCSD 
matched the 
specific strengths of the 
AP
 
with those of 
a principal. As a r
esult
 
of this newfound 
understanding of strengths
, the district believes
 
that 
it was 
d
oing a better job 
overall of fitting people into various school situations as a team and fitting them 
to the culture of the community. 
If successful candidates

 
strengths
 
did not match 
those of 
existing principal
s
, the district was reluctant to place them in a situation 
that 
would 
not work for them or for the school
 
and 
advised 
them 
to find ways to 
enhance
 
their teacher leadership at their school sites.
 
Leadership course c
urriculum.
 
A group of senior administrators that 
included the superintendent, deputy superintendent, and assistant superintendent 
determined t
he course curriculum for leadership training at MCSD. The 
curriculum was based on their collective sense of what t
hey perceived was 
occurring 
in the field and on what they 
had 
gleaned from the observations of other 
administrators. 
They generated 
ideas for content through a process that involved 
87
 
 
extrapolating information from the professional growth plans of administra
tors. A 
district leadership formation and training program was not offered in 2007 
because the district was in the process of changing its format. The transit
ion 
began that year with the re
organization of the selection process of administrators 
to include 
Gallup

s online assessment tools and with the expansion of leadership 
development to encompass a broader base that built ground
-
level leadership 
capacity in other areas besides administration. 
The district believes
 
that 
its 
leadership development program d
id not have to lead directly to formal 
administrative positions in the school, but that teachers could go back to schools 
where they were encouraged to become the best teacher leader or the b
est 
department head within the
 
school environment.
 
The curriculum
 
for developing capacity in potential educational 
administrators originally drew solely from the 

Role of the Principal

 
document 
to incorporate specific training 
on 
policies and procedures in the district, as well 
as on professional development topics suc
h as spiritual and managerial leadership. 
A shift in curricular focus included ways for administrators to use their strengths 
to build engaged schools; 
this 
topic 
has 
largely 
been 
influenced by resources 
published by the Gallup 
Organization
. The district

s
 
leadership training also 
included individual review of t
he results from the assessment 
StrengthFinder
 
to 
individualize a growth plan 
(Gallup,
 
Inc.,
 
2009
a
).
 
District Structuring of the Experience of a New Assistant Principal
 
The 
deputy superintendent and 
t
he assistant superintendent 
of MCSD
 
facilitated an orientation at the beginning of the school year for first
-
year APs and 
88
 
 
principals new to 
their 
position
s
. The purpose of the orientation was 
to familiarize 
this group of new administrators with the work of
 
the district

s Human Resources 
and Learning Services departments. Following this introduction, all APs attended 
the principal meetings once a month and partook in their professional 
development sessions. The agenda for these meetings was replete primarily
 
with 
items that concerned leadership and the principal and did not typically address 
any issues specific to the role of the AP
.
 
Some of the topics that unfolded in professional development sessions 
during that year and that impacted all of MCSD

s
 
administ
rators were spiritual 
leadership, administrative policies and procedures, classroom walk
-
throughs as 
part of supervision and monitoring, training 
for 
new people 
o
n the Instrument for 
the Observation of Teaching Activities (an evaluation tool 
that involves 
a 
collaborative approach between the teacher and the evaluator), and 
the 
development
 
of 
interview skill
s
 
for administrators. As well, people from the 
Gallup 
Organization 
offered 
a session on working with strengths and building 
engaged schools. 
The 
same com
mittee that o
rganized the leadership program 
often determined these topics.
 
School District Conceptions of Leadership
 
Diverse values and underlying assumptions influence 
how 
leadership is 
understood and practiced in a particular school district. 
In MCSD, e
ducational 
leadership 
has been 
enacted primarily from the perspectives described in the 

Role of the Principal 
for School Administrator Evaluation

 
document
 
that 
encompass
 
cultural, instructional, and managerial/
organizational leadership 
89
 
 
approaches. Overa
ll, the principal as an educational leader 
is 
responsible for 
the 
achievement of the mission and educational goals established for the school and 
the district
 
and
 
for the implementation of 
b
oard policies and administrative 
directi
ves. The principal role in
cludes
 
accountability for maintaining a high 
standard of education in the school through ongoing supervision and evaluation of 
curricular, co
-
curricular
,
 
and extra
-
curricular activities. In addition, and with the 
assistance of the AP, 
the principal oversee
s school
-
based decision 
making 
(management) and school councils, the planning and control of the expenditure of 
school funds, the evaluation and reporting of student learning and development, 
and the supervision of all school st
aff. The AP

s role also incl
udes
 
other duties, 
responsibilities, and obligations as assigned by the principal.
 
MCSD
 
has
 
a strong link between leadership development and human 
resources because of the joint responsibilities inherent in the deputy 
superintendent position. The district 
had sought more precision in
 
people

s 
potential had for various district jobs by 
hiring the best possible staffs; this was 
also part of the impetus for establishing a partnership with the Gallup 
Organization
. The district vision of leadership 
was 
shaped ar
ound the notion of 
talent
, which
 
is an indicator of whether someone 
will repeatedly perform
 
at a 
higher level. This vision of leadership 
is intended 
to ensure that the most talented 
people 
a
re available to the district

s students.
 
The 
district believes
 
tha
t the 
implementation of this program 
would 
have 
the potential 
for 
greater efficiency in improving teacher and student performance. 
90
 
 
It impacted every aspect of MCSD

s practices related to the recruitment of teacher 
leaders and the development of leadership 
in educational administrators.
 
On Becoming a New Assistant Principal: The Case of Brian
 
Background and Context
 
In the fall of 2007 Brian became a new 
AP
 
at Our Lady of Guadalupe 
Junior High School, an urban school 
located in a central, mid
-
socio
economic 
ne
ighbourhood. 
The school is 
one of 
18 
in the MCSD
; it
 
employs
 
25 teachers and 
10 support staff
, who
 
serve 500 students from 
Grades
 
7 to 9.
 
Brian graduated in 
secondary education with a double major in physical 
education and social studies.
 
He described his 
motivation 
to become
 
an educator 
as a desire to have an impact on students and learning. He started his teaching 
career at an elementary
-
junior high school in another rural district 60 kilometres 
from MCSD. After three years he moved into a high school tea
ching position 
within the same distric
t and taught there for 15 years; he
 
served as a physical 
education department head for 11 of those years. During this time he developed 
and taught a new sports
 
medicine curriculum. From 2003 to 
2007 Brian 
completed a 
m
aster

s degree 
program 
in educational leadership at one of the 
provincial universities.
 
Preparation for the Administrative Role
 
Brian

s identity as an educational leader was being formed long before he 
became
 
a leader
. His experience as a department head a
nd his graduate work 
towards a 
m
aster

s degree 
helped to prepare him 
for the educational leadership 
role of 
AP
. 
In the position of department head of a large high school, Brian was 
91
 
 
responsible for supervising 
seven
 
people and 
managing
 
a budget line of 
$130
,000.00. 
His knowledge of curriculum in sports medicine, physical 
education, and social studies also contributed to 
his 
credibility as a teacher and a 
leader. As a student 
in pursuit of 
a 
m
aster

s degree, Brian had switched from 
curriculum studies to educa
tional leadership and administration within the first 
few months because he felt that 
t
he educational leadership program offered him 
opportunities to study leadership from different perspectives. He chose to 
concentrate on courses 
on 
leadership styles (e.g
.
,
 
transformational,
 
instructional, 
and managerial)
 
rather than on what he called just 

straight administration

 
or 
how the school is run.
 
As culminating activities for his 
m
aster

s degree, Brian completed two 
internships, one 
that 
involved an exploration 
of sustainable leadership based on 
the 
work 
of 
Hargreaves (2003)
 
and the other the ambitious development of 23 
individual projects, many with staff at his high school. These projects ranged from 
the creation of exams to the organizing of a separate physica
l education
 
class for 
the school

s special
-
needs
 
students
. Brian commented that he learned many 
lessons from his experience 
with 
implementing the numerous projects; for 
example, he was surprised 
at 
the large number of opportunities open to teachers 
outside
 
their own classroom
s
. He also observed that some of his colleagues 
resented his involvement in their classrooms or departments, 
whereas 
others 
embraced it. Although Brian also had 
had 
many experiences as a teacher leader in 
his previous district, he expre
ssed disappointment with 
its 
leadership preparation 
program. It had been continually cancelled by senior district staff because of low 
92
 
 
interest
,
 
and Brian

s ability to move forward as a prospective administrator was 
continually frustrated. However, his des
ire to become an administrator 
precipitated his application to and acceptance by 
MCSD
 
in 2007.
 
Induction 
Into 
the Role of Assistant Principal
 
 
District support for new assistant principals. 
From Brian

s perspective, 
new administrators were inducted into MC
SD in a variety of ways; for example, 
leadership meetings on relevant topics were held monthly for all principals and 
AP
s. Earlier in the year the district had 
introduced a program that described how 
to teach and lead by focusing on personal strengths and 
by nurturing the strengths 
of others. This program was based on publications and resources from the Gallup 
Organization 
and included an online component 
for district staff 
that required the 
completion of a one
-
hour test to reveal their strengths. Brian exp
lained that 
individual strengths were then matched to create 

the right mix of people in 
administration.

 
For example, this assessment revealed his principal

s strength as 
a 

developer,

 
which was then matched 
with 
Brian

s identified strength as a 

learner
.

 
Brian considered the online assessment of 
his 
strengths extremely 
accurate
,
 
although he was surprised at the top five 
on 
which 
the Gallup program 
advised 
him 
to focus. Out of 64 possible strengths, Brian revealed that he 
is 
primarily a learner, achiever
, 
and 
relater
 
and is
 
empathic, and he explained that 
there was a 

piece

 
on 
responsibility. He described the program as a directive 

not 
[to] 
worry about your weaknesses any
 
more and [to] really build on your 
strengths and then use the strengths of others 
to fill in the gaps that you might 
have.

 
93
 
 
Brian

s opinion of this approach to professional development was that it 
was generally successful throughout the district in spite of initial collegial 
skepticism. He added, however, that administrators were still 

finding their way 
through the whole concept.

 
The district, according to Brian, expected school 
leaders to provide time for their staffs to complete the online assessment to 
determine the strengths of the pe
ople in the school. The results

a list of
 
indivi
dual teachers

 
strengths

were then to be posted in the staff room so that 
others would know who
m
 
to approach for help with their weaknesses. Brian 
observed that, in the end, it 
might 
not matter 
what the individual strengths were, 
but that there were benefi
ts to finding five essentially good qualities 
on which 
to 
focus. An additional dimension to this assessment, Brian added, was that the 
d
eputy 
s
uperintendent of Human Resources was looking at it as part of the hiring 
process for teachers and principals. Bri
an 
considered 
the online test very 
reasonable and teacher
 
based, but he commented on the district

s disinclination to 
permit applicants to see their own test scores and 
their 
rankings
 
against other 
applicants. He did, however, have access to the scores of 
the teachers who were 
shortlisted 
for interviews
 
for positions in his school
,
 
and, he wondered, 

What 
made a 65 on that list better than a 50 
[
ranking
]
?

 
He and his principal ultimately 
hired three people who had lower scores than the other applicants, 
whi
ch left 
Brian unsure 
about 
how this 

piece

 
(the ranking system) was helping to identify 
the best teachers and leaders.
 
Brian wa
s a beginning 
AP
 
being inducted into MCSD, 
and his 
principal
,
 
he explained, was designated as his mentor. However, Brian felt th
at he had not 
94
 
 
yet received enough feedback from her about his per
formance after seven months 
in
 
the AP role. He described the extent of his administrative training as a matter of 

get
[ting]
 
in the building and get
[ting]
 
to work, more than anything.

 
Brian 
expressed his 
concern 
as being 

not really all that in need of knowing if he was 
doing the right job
,
 
[but] very much wanting to know if he was doing the wrong 
job.

 
Lack of feedback, for Brian, inhibited his creativity and confidence. In spite 
of this imp
ediment, his principal served as a role model who exemplified to Brian 

amazing expertise

 
as a leader. He described her leadership style as flexible in its 
responsiveness to a variety of situations. Her approach changed according to 

what

s coming at her
,
 
because she [could] take a hard
-
line disciplinary 
leadership style
,

 
or she could jump into the role of an educational leader, data 
cruncher, or managerial leader, as required. 
Brian

s image of himself as a leader 
was not as broad.
 
New understandings of l
eadership.
 
Brian perceived himself 
as 
primarily 
an instructional leader whose approach to teacher education was to find 
professional literature and facilitate pedagogical discussion
s
 
during staff meeting
s
 
based on 
the staff

s professional growth plans. Bri
an also facilitated collaborative 
discussions with 
teachers 
on 
practice by releasing them from their classes. He 
measure
d
 
his success as this type of leader 
based on
 
the 
teacher
s

 
requests for 
more professional readings and the extent to which their conver
sations 
on 
practice 
extended beyond staff meetings. He stated implicitly that he was more inter
ested 
in the 

educational piece

 
of leadership than 
in 
being a transformational
 
leader. 
From his course
work at university Brian understood transformational leade
rship 
95
 
 
as the
 
ability of an exceptionally strong leader 

to take a school to new places and 
not just into new realms of education that are going on out there.

 
He viewed 
transformational leadership as an 

interesting

 
idea but described it as a little 
scary
, not educationally sound, and 

pretty unexplored.

 
According to Brian, 
these types of leaders often go away
 
after a time, 
creating 
a 

never
-
lasting peace

 
for those who are left to make sense of their direction. As a result of this 
understanding, Brian st
ated that he felt more comfortable leading with research 
practices that 
a
re very practical and easy to understand and that 
a
re clearly 
connected to instruction, such as recent work on assessment, brain
-
based learning, 
and backward design planning.
 
When 
I 
a
sked 
Brian 
to describe a metaphor that more clearly illustrated his 
style of leadership, 
he 
drew on the metaphor
 
of getting on the right bus:
 
Well
,
 
I know I kind of went into [administration] thinking about being the 
bus driver. Okay, well
,
 
now I

m going t
o drive the bus
,
 
and everybody on 
the bus is going to kind of follow along. It

s nothing like that. I had that 
idea years ago and
 
then, getting here [at school], 
you

re in the back of the 
bus with the rest of them and wondering
,
 
Who

s 
driving? Sometimes th
e 
bus is going where it

s going! We have to figure out how to make sure it 
doesn

t go off the road!
 
Brian 
observed that this shift from being the bus driver (the solo leader) to being 
another passenger emphasized his newfound perception that sharing leader
ship 
with teachers and his principal was a more accurate reflection of what he was 
actually
 
doing
. 
He 
explained that he came to recognize that he did not have all of 
the answers as a leader and that it was important to develop collaborative 
relationships w
ith the other 

passengers

 
because he saw that they were 

all in 
this together.

 
96
 
 
New and challenging situations. 
During this period of induction into the 
AP role, Brian 
faced 
challenging situations 
that involved
 
his own classroom 
teaching and his relations
hips with staff and students. He 
believes
 
that APs ought 
to teach in a classroom to gain or to maintain both the
 
classroom teacher

s point 
of view and that of the student 
with regard to
 

what

s going on

 
in the school. 
However, in spite of his intention to
 
positively impact students

 
education,
 
he saw 
his own teaching suffer as a result of absences that frequently called him away 
from the two classes 
that he taught:
 
I have one class that

s been just fabulous and one that

s just awful .
 
.
 
. 
because I

ve had 
so many meetings on those particular days. I

ve been [in 
the school] for seven months
,
 
and classroom rules are still an issue. If I 
was a regular classroom teacher, that class would not be challenging the 
rules. When I walk in there sometimes, I think, 
Wha
t

s going on? 
I think
,
 
I

ve forgotten how to teac
h! The kids

 
attitude is [that]
,
 
Every 
once in a
 
while you show up, and you try to teach us, and we

re not going to do 
anything. And it drives me crazy too. I

ve always been considered to be a 
good teacher
,
 
and now this is my nightmare: bad teaching.
 
Becoming an AP in this new environment also impacted Brian

s 
relationships with students on a broader scope. He described these student 
relationships in his new school setting as quite different 
from his relation
ships 
as 
a classroom teacher because, in his position as an administrator, 

nine out of 
ten
 
times

 
his conversations with students in his office were not of a positive nature. 
Brian

s relationships with teachers also took on a different slant; although 
tea
chers attempted to build collegial rapport, he perceived that they treated him 
differently 
from the 
other classroom teachers. Soon after his arrival at the school, 
they were quick to describe to him the details of their programs, practices, and 
any major c
oncerns that were pressing
 
to them
. Brian believes
 
that they expected 
97
 
 
him to comply with their current practices
, but 
it took him a while 

to put a spin

 
o
n these practices or procedures, and 
he eventually developed his own approach 
to an issue. One such e
xample was the challenges 
with 
regard to
 
t
he soundness of 
existing school
-
discipline practices. Brian felt compelled to try 
to 
change one of 
them beca
use of its perceived unfairness:
 
We have a policy here, for instance, in the school, and I was dealing wit
h 
it today, where if a substitute teacher sends a kid out for misbehavio
u
r, 
they

re suspended for the rest of the day.
 
They stay down here
,
 
and they 
g
et
 
al
l of their material to work. I believe that the only way for a kid to get 
an education is to stay in 
class. That rule supports the substitute teachers, 
yes, but at the same time, it jeopardizes the educational setting of the 
students for the day.
 
Although 
teaching staff and substitute teachers have greatly favoured 
this 
schoolwide policy on discipline for
 
over 
five
 
years, Brian began to question the 
practice early in the school year. His strategy was to discuss the nature of each 
student

s offence with the particular teacher 
and 
how 
the 
decision to remove the 
student affected learning. His goal to shift th
e policy 
to 
what he felt were more 

student
-
centered

 
ways met with both teacher
s

 
approval 
of 
the change 
and 
some 
resistance to an alternative structure. Brian observed that some teachers 

push

 
to 
have it their way
,
 
and 

somet
imes you [as the administrat
or]
 
have to give a little 
bit.

 
He felt confident that his attempts 
to negotiate
 
his position with teachers 
would eventually meet with more success.
 
In this chapter I reported aspects of Brian

s school district related to its 
training of new educational le
aders and 
how 
the district structures
 
the experience 
of its beginning administrators. I also presented the case of Brian, a first
-
year AP 
98
 
 
with MCSD: 
his background, how he prepared for the administrative role, and his 
interpretation 
of his induction into t
he role.
 
Chapter five continues the account and interpretation of data from the 
perspectives of 
TCSD
 
and two of its new 
AP
s.

CHAPTER FIVE:
 
BECOMING AN ASSISTANT PRINCIPAL IN
 
TRINITY CATHOLIC SCHOOL DISTRICT
 
School District and Perspective on Becoming an A
ssistant Principal
 
TCSD is the second school district in the study. TCSD 
is 
an urban 
Catholic school district in a medium
-
sized city in a 
Western 
Canadian province 
that 
at the time of this research 
served over 35,000 students in 
80 
schools and was 
governed
 
by seven elected trustees whose mandate was to emphasize strategic 
leadership and positive relationships with the district

s interest groups.
3
 
The 
district was also led by a superintendent and six assistant superintendents of 
departments that included Lea
dership, Learning, Technology, Facilities, Human 
Resources, and Religious Services, as well as
 
25
 
consultants 
who supported
 
religious instruction, curriculum, technology, and special education.
 
 
TCSD

s mission and vision 
is 
to provide a 
Catholic education 
that inspires 
and prepares
 
students to live fully and answer the call to a faith
-
filled life of 
service. T
he beliefs of the district include a call 
for the 
transformation of the 
world through Catholic education
;

Jesus Christ is the model and teacher for all. On 
its Web site
 
TCSD 
maintains
 
that 
parents send their children to schools in thei
r district because they believe
 
that it 
is 
imp
ortant for children to 
strengthen their faith overall and to learn 
the 
values and 
morals necessary for a full and productive life for themselves and the wider 
community.
 
 
In

I explained that school districts ar
e obligated to account for 
the
 
di
strictwide performance 
of their schools 
to the Ministry of Education through 
a 

Three
-
Year Education Plan

 
and the AERR. In 
its 
2007
-
2008 AERR, TCSD 
identified three areas of priority: 
(a)
 
the pre
servation of Catholic education, 
(b)
 
continued support and e
ncouragement for s
tudent learning and achievement,
 
and 
(c)
 
advocacy for district infrastructure, transportation funding, and funding 
for special edu
cation. The district highlight
ed
 
the
 
accomplishments and future 
plans 
of 
every department, and I 
will 
draw a
ttention primarily to the work of the 
Department of Leadership Services.
 
 
In the annual report the Department of Leadership Services emphasized 
the importance of succession planning for the district through the identification, 
training
,
 
and development of 
aspiring an
d current leaders. TCSD

s policy is 
to 
ensure an adequate number of candidates who 
can 
be called upon to fill vacant 
school
-
based and district
-
level administrative
 
positions. The district offer
ed
 
six 
programs 
to develop
 
Catholic educational 
lead
ers
 
that 
include
d
 
a principal 
academy, principal and new principal training, 
AP
 
sessions and new 
AP
 
training, 
and 
leadership formation and training for teachers and consultants. The 
principal 
academy program 
focuse
d
 
professional 
development on the role of 
the principal 
101
 
 
to 
ensure that 
principals 
ha
d
 
the skills and tools they need
ed
 
to be effective 
leaders. Professional development sessions 
have 
typically 
taken 
on a reflect
ive 
nature because they provide
 
infor
mation to principals and 
create 
opportunities for 
process work. 
In m
onthly sessions new principals in TCSD 
focus
 
on the key areas 
of 
religious, instructional, and managerial leadership. New principals 
a
re 
mentored by an experienced principal and 
have 
opportunities 
for them 
to meet
 
that include
 
a school vi
sit component.
 
Although leadership 
is 
the unofficial purview of all district departments, 
the district

s De
partment of Leadership Services has
 
the mandate to work with 
administrators in two distinct but related ways, one 
of which is to 
develop 
leadership p
rograms and 
arrange
 
mentorship and professional development 
activities for the district

s school
-
based admin
istrators. A second way involves
 
more direct administrative support for the day
-
to
-
day operation of the schools and 
the district. Members of Leaders
hip Services me
e
t weekly to discuss issues 
that 
arise
 
from schools 
that are 
often related to leadership
 
and
 
are 
at times driven by a 
principal

s personal leadership style. Leadership Services 
has 
worked hand
-
in
-
hand with the district

s school
-
based adminis
trators to determine programming 
for leadership formation and training as well as other district leadership programs.
 
Leadership Training in the District
 
TCSD

s 
leadership formation and training program could be c
ompleted as 
a graduate
-
level course. The pr
ogram 
challenged its teacher and consultant 
participants to critically analyze their current leadership status. Teachers and 
consultants in the district with a continuous contract who were considering a 
102
 
 
career in school
-
based administration were invited to
 
apply to TCSD

s leadership 
formation and training program, which 
was offered 
every year. The district 
selected approximately 30 teachers who met eight times throughout the school 
year and were mentored by five principals from the elementary and secondary 
levels. The course curriculum for TCSD

s leadership formation and training 
focused on 

the essence of Catholic educational leadership within the constructs 
of a school
-
based p
rofessional learning community.

 
Senior administrators in 
Leadership Services det
ermined t
he 
curriculum of the 
specific program
s
 
based on 
their understanding of the needs of the 
teacher leaders in their schools and by 
timely administrative issues. Teachers and consultants were exposed to topics 
such as school culture, spiritual l
eaders
hip, and human resources; 
then, in a 
culminating project (a term paper), they were expected to reflect on their own 
leadership style and goals as Catholic educational leaders. This leadership and 
formation program was intended to honour the fact that some 
people
 
were very 
good teacher leaders
 
and acknowledged that not all of them should pursue 
administration. Exposing teachers to some of the literature on leadership, 
however, combined with opportunities to discuss educational practice, helped to 
lay the gro
undwork for aspiring leaders.
 
Application process for aspiring assistant principals. 
To become an AP 
with TCSD, teachers and consultants were required to complete a very lengthy 
and intense application form, which invited the written support of eight colle
agues 
and a principal, as well as a letter from a parish priest confirming the staff 
member

s commitment to the Catholic Church. Applicants were encouraged to 
103
 
 
consider TCSD

s publication 

Characteristics of the Successful School 
Administrator,

 
which brief
ly described the attributes of an instructional, 
religious, and managerial leader, as well as the desired personal qualities and 
skills of a school leader (see Appendix D for a synopsis of this district 
publication). 
Although 
applicants who did not 
reach 
t
he interview stage might 
have something to offer the school district, it 
might 
not be developed enough 
for 
them to proceed as 
viable candidate
s
. The teachers and consultants who 
reach the 
interview stage 
are interviewed early in the new year by a panel of 
eight 
educators, comprised of district staff from Leadership Services, Human 
Resources, 
and 
Learning Services, as well as administrators and classroom 
teachers. 
In the interviews
 
for school
-
based administrative position
s
, the interview 
panel generally acqu
ired
 
a strong sense overall of the applicants

 
potential, in 
spite of the tension 
of 
the actual interview. Teachers and consultants who were 
selected for an administrative
-
based position were then either assigned to a school 
or 
placed in a pool of candidat
es
 
until a position arose.
 
Support for new and experienced assistant principals. 
The role of the 
AP
 
served as the basis for the new AP t
raining program and focused on 
training 
participants in their roles and discussing best practices. New APs were exposed 
to 
current literature and mentorship with experienced APs. The 
district

s 
curriculum 
for professional development 
for first
-
year APs was driven by questions that the 
new APs themselves
 
generated or
 
by current research, timely issues, and
,
 
at times, 
the nee
ds of the district. Some of the professional development topics for first
-
year APs were coding and assessing students for
 
placement in district programs
 
104
 
 
and 
the 
issues or district and provincial policies that 
had 
changed during the 
previous year. At times 
there 
was 
overlap with the professional development 
offered by TCSD

s collective group of APs.
 
The district

s 
AP sessions that develop Catholic educational leaders were 
geared towards 
broadening the skills of 
AP
s to ensure that they were adequately 
prepare
d for the role of principal. This group met for four afternoons throughout 
the year. Originally, their mandate focused on wellness and 
the 
establis
hment of
 
a 
basis of mutual AP support, but in the previous two years
 
the
 
agenda had become 
more closely linke
d to the professional development organized through 
Leadership Services; at times these sessions reflected many of the same themes 
that had been 
developed 
for principals, especially religious leadership, which was 
linked to all professional development 
for
 
principals and senior administrators in 
the district. There were challenges to providing professional development that 
was relevant to all APs, many of whom were at different 
stages 
in terms of their 
needs as administrators. Other challenges were the wide
 
variation
s
 
in the number 
of 
years of teaching experience and the number of years 
that APs had been 
in 
the
ir
 
role. As well, the unique context of each school (size, location) and the level 
of instruction 
that 
each school
 
offered

either elementary or second
ary

had to 
be taken into consideration. Generally, though, an afternoon session for the larger 
group of APs consisted of a religious component and brief professional 
development sessions on instructional and managerial leadership.
 
In addition, TCSD

s
 
princ
ipal training program 
offered 
training to 
experienced 
AP
s who intended to apply for a principalship in the future; this 
105
 
 
program could also be 
completed as a graduate
-
level course
. 
The p
articipants 
engaged in reflection, professional dialogue, and training 
o
n the district

s software 
applications.
 
The role of Trinity Catholic School District

s evaluation documents.
 
Like 
MCSD
, TCSD drew on the key functions, competencies, and skills of 
administrator
s
 
as outlined in their performance appraisal document
s
 
to shap
e 
its 
leadership and formation programs. 
These 
document
s
 
also influenced the 
professional development for 
AP
s and other school administrators. The 

Performance Appraisal of a School Administrator

 
identified 
four leadership 
components that described 
admini
strators

 
performance in terms of work quality 
and 
their 
understanding of the goals and objectives of the district. 
TCSD expected 
principals 
and APs to meet expectations as 
religious/
moral/
ethical leaders and
 
educational and instructional leader
s and to be
 
effective managerial leader
s (see 
Appendix
 
E for a synopsis of this document). APs were evaluated for continuous 
designation in the second year of their position 
of 
schoo
l
-
based administrator. The 
principal of the school conducted the 
evaluation
,
 
and, in the event that the 
principal required support in the evaluation process, the Department of 
Leadership Services provided professional development sessions for them.
 
Develop
ing an administrative team. 
In TCSD
 
the process to match new
 
or 
any APs 
with schools

 
principal
s
 
was based primarily upon the guiding principles 
articulated in a district document on administrative placements. These principles 
were prioritized based on var
ious district needs. 
A team of senior administrators 
made the a
dministrative placements 
after considering
 
the needs of the students at 
106
 
 
the school
s
, the needs of the staff, the district

s needs related
 
to succession 
planning and building leadership capacity
, and finally, the expressed requests of 
the administrator
s
 
who 
were 
seeking new personal growth opportunities. In 
addition, Leadership Services extensively used information 
that 
the administrators 
themselves 
provided 
through a second district document, 
t
h
e 

Administrator 
Profile.

 
This profile comprised personal and professional information such as 
address, desired location, current and previous placements, and goals.
 
The district attempted t
o match administrators

 
unique 
skill sets. For 
example, when some
one from a secondary level 
was moving 
into an elementary 
school as an AP, an administr
ative partner
 
with a strong literacy focus might have 
been selected as a match
,
 
or perhaps someone with a deeper knowledge of 
elementary
-
related curriculum. In situations
 
in which 
the administrative team 
experienced difficulties, senior administrators were committed to helping 
to 
guide 
the 
administrators through their conflict. Although TCSD 
assumed
 
that two adults 
who worked
 
together in a school 
would 
to do so successfull
y, the criteria that the 
district used 
to make
 
administrative placements did not always account for 
compatibility with the existing administrator. The district

s senior administrators 
worked primarily with principals to ensure a smooth and successful schoo
l 
operation
,
 
and they also 
assumed 
that, in turn, 
the 
principals were working to that 
same end with their APs to 
build on the APs

 
skill
s
 
and elevate the
ir
 
leadership 
competencies. The district maintained a vested interest in making the 
administration expe
rience successful for the whole school community.
 
107
 
 
Leadership course curriculum.
 
When a first
-
year AP was assigned to a 
school, the school district

s leaders assumed that principals would provide 
mentorship and a curriculum for the AP to follow. According t
o one district 
leader, some principals did not mentor their APs effectively because they were 
simply too busy or inexperienced themselves. When new APs arrived at the 
beginning of a school year, they were usually assigned a variety of tasks that 
typically 
assisted the principal in completing whatever work needed to be done 
for the school at that moment. Some new APs received very little direction from 
their principals in terms of role clarity and how to 
perform 
the tasks associated 
with the role. To partial
ly fill this gap 
in support for
 
new APs in their role, 
TCSD 
offered a course for first
-
year APs that 
at that time had been 
in operation for over 
five years. During the 2007 school year, as part of the 

New AP

 
course 
curriculum, senior district staff 
made 
presentations
 
to a group of 15 beginning 
APs on topics such as district policies and structures, adm
inistrative technology, 
special
-
needs coding, teacher supervision and evaluation, 
and 
legal 
responsibilities
;
 
and 
they also assigned 
select
ed
 
readings. New 
APs had 
opportunities to be mentored more directly in these meetings by experienced APs 
in the district.
 
District Structuring of the Experience of a New Assistant Principal
 
In TCSD many factors structured the experience of a new AP
,
 
but the 
principal 
had 
t
he largest role. However, one dist
rict leader felt that 
principals 
sometimes 
did not perform 
very well in 
the role, possibly as a result of their 
limited time, inexperience, or even a particular leadership approach. This district 
108
 
 
leader compared an adminis
trative team to an 

arranged m
arriage,

 
which 
sometimes works
 
and sometimes 
does 
not. As well, the team had to work hard 
to 
ensure
 
that their personalities did not get in the way of their work and their 
relationship
s
 
with 
the school community. The district
 
maintained that the 
principal was essentially the 

boss

 
of the school, and 
it was 
therefore up to the 
AP to make the relationship 
between the two of them 
work when there was a 
problem.
 
Although the district

s ideal leadership structure was a leadership t
eam, 
some administrators did not share a common understanding of 
team
 
and how the 
AP and principal in the school 
team 
actually 
applied 
the 
concept. Some principals 
were more comfortable than others 
with 
sharing some or all of the decision
 
making with their
 
administrative colleagues and teacher leaders. The issue at hand 
was that, 
ultimately
, 
the 
responsibility for 
all aspects of 
the school still fell 
to 
the 
principal
, who would
 
therefore at times act more unilaterally. The district fully 
suppor
ted the team 
approach, but the 
team was ultimately 
not 
responsible 
for 
fulfilling
 
the school

s mandate, and until this particular reality changed, 
collaborative practices would be uneven from school to school.
 
The s
taff 
in 
Leadership Services continued to accumulate cu
rrent literature 
on APs that assisted 
them 
in structuring the experience of beginning AP
s
, but they 
pointed out 
that 
very little research 
was available
. As in other districts, the AP 
position was in essence a training role for the principalship
;
 
and, in sp
ite of the 
paucity of research on APs, 
TCSD did not consider 
the status and role of the AP 
less important than either the principal or the teacher role.
 
109
 
 
School District Conceptions of Leadership
 
In the AERR for 2007
-
2008, TCSD

s superintendent called for i
ts leaders 
to renew their emphasis on social justice and to work towards more effective 
cooperation 
among 
all school sites and departments. In an interview a district 
leader articulated a vision of leadership for TCSD as one in which administrators 
lead wi
th personal integri
ty, ethics, and some creativity
 
and 
are 
willing to take 
risks to move ahead. In support of these conceptions of leadership, the district 
planned monthly meetings for principals with a focus on personal integrity and 
ethics and through pr
esentations and discussions on Catholic educational 
leadership and social justice. The main challenge to a vision of leadership, 
according to the district leader, was to move all
 
aspects of leadership 
(instructional and managerial) to a moral and ethical p
ath.
 
The district leader identified a second vision of leadership: that all leaders 
become instructional leaders, no matter the sch
ool size, and that 
principals be 
more hands
-
on in terms of knowing what was happening in their schools 

in the 
best interest 
of teaching and learning in the classroom.

 
This involvement 
of 
the 
principal presented more of a challenge at the secondary level and much less of a 
problem in elementary, because of the many operational tasks that took 
precedence in junior and senior hig
h schools. As well, secondary schools reli
ed 
more
 
on department heads as instructional leaders because of their unique 
expertise in curriculum areas. Nevertheless, the district perspective was that a 
TCSD 
secondary principal should know 
whether 
the content
 
was being delivered 
appropriately and meeting students

 
needs. During the 2007
-
2008 school year, 
110
 
 
school districts in the province explored a newly formulated document published 
by the government on what constitutes quality practice for principals. This 
do
cument prompted much discussion in TCSD at principal meetings throughout 
the year as administrators attempted to name some
 
of the actions that contributed
 
to effective leadership within their schools.
 
I asked a TCSD district leader to create a metaphor tha
t described a 
leadership style analogous to practice at the district level. The resultant image was 
that of a parent 

who is trying to give people their wings.

 
Lik
e a parent, this 
leader believes
 
that it 
is 
important to lay down the ground rules for admin
istrators 
(or children), but to build in some flexibility when the rule
s need
 
to be bent:
 
When you feel like [the children] are ready to take the car on a trip to 
Vancouver, [you say]
,
 

Good
-
bye
.
 
I won

t worry about you at all.

 
If 
they

re only going to tr
avel 150 
kilometres
 
and it

s the first time they

re 
taking the car, I

m going to say, 

Check 
in with me
;
 
phone me.

 
It

s a 
little bit more controlling.
 
This leader indicated that, although it 
is 
desirable for all administrators to 
have the skills 
they need
 
to be successful, the issue was more complex. 
The 
district has 
so many beginning APs at that point that there was a perceived need to 
more regularly revisit the rules than bend them because 
either 
most administrators 

can

t remember [them] any
 
more
,
 
or [t
hey] weren

t taught them.

 
On Becoming a New Assistant Principal: The Case of Roger
 
Background and Context
 
Roger became an 
AP
 
in 2007 at Padre Pio Junior High School, which is 
part of TCSD in 
Western 
Canada. Padre Pio Junior High served a population of 
ove
r 300 students in 
Grades
 
7 to 9, with 25 teachers and 7 support staff.
 
111
 
 
School had always been a comfortable place for Roger. 
As 
a student in 
senior high school
 
he already aspired to pursuing
 
his passion for learning by 
becoming a teacher. Four years after 
he received his Bachelor of Education 
degree with a major in French and a minor in mathematics, he began a 
m
aster

s 
degree
 
program
, also in 
e
ducation, 
and completed
 
it in 1995. All administrators in 
TCSD must eventually 
attain 
a 
master

s 
degree to receive 
a continuous 
designation. Roger explained that he did not have a career in administration in 
mind at that time, but that he sim
ply perceived himself as a life
long learner. 
At 
the time of his interview he was in the process of studying for a Graduate 
Diplom
a in Religious Education because he wanted the knowledge 
that 
the 
diploma 
program 
offered.
 
Preparation for the Administrative Role
 
During his 15 years in a classroom Roger honed his teaching skills and 
took on various school leadership roles, such as coord
inating religious 
celebrations and setting the direction for the teaching staff

s professional 
development. Roger

s preparation for an administrative role with the TCSD began 
to more formally take shape at Padre Pio Junior High School in 2002 when he 
serve
d as his administrators

 
replacement
,
 
or what he called their 

hitter,

 
in their 
absence. This experience 
gave 
Roger a new perspective 
on 
administrative tasks 
and responsibilities and prompted his application 
for 
a leadership position within 
his district. 
He recalled feeling 

really flattered

 
by collegial support at school, 
but he was not successful in becoming an AP that first time. Roger was also 
disappointed with the feedback 
that 
he received in a debriefing session. The 
112
 
 
district representative from the
 
interview committee did not explain what he could 
improve upon
, and h
e resumed his efforts as a teacher.
 
Administrative equivalent.
 
Three years later in a different junior high 
school, Roger applied a second time for an administrative position. He had aga
in 
assumed 
the same types of leadership roles in this new school, but he added the 
assignment of 

administrative equivalent

 
when a shift of principals occurred at 
Spring Break of that year. An administrative equivalent role was open to teacher 
leaders in 
the school who were interested in a leadership position and might 
want 
to take on 
the responsibilities of an 
AP
 
for a short term. Roger described this 
novel experience as 

kind of strange

 
and uncomfortable because
,
 
in the role, he 
became privy to personal
 
information about his colleagues and the school

s 
students. He found that the temporary status of this role at times
 
compromised
 
his 
collegial relationships, in spite of his principal

s attempts to separate staff issues
 
from other AP responsibilities:
 
You
 
knew that when you left [this temporary role], you had to go back to 
being that person

s working colleague, and you didn

t want to have too 
much knowledge
,
 
.
 
.
 
. and sometimes you had to bracket it. You couldn

t 
really act upon it because they may not kno
w that you know.
 
District leadership training.
 
Roger subscribed to his district

s leadership 
and formation program during this same year. He described the program as 
practical in nature
, with
 
such topics as technology and inclusive education, but
,
 
in 
retro
spect, it
s
 
information was easy 
for APs 
to find when the need arose. Roger 
felt that during this training, he benefited most from occasions when the mentor 
principals facilitated table discussions. He confessed that his most vivid 
recollection of these ses
sions was one in which he became 

a little bit terrified

 
at 
113
 
 
the principals

 
stories about conflict management. This was an area of concern for 
Roger because he considered conflict resolution a critical skill for an educational 
leader
,
 
and he perceived his
 
own lack in this area as not easily remedied by role
 
playing and hypothetical scenarios. Hypothetical scenarios, he explained, did not 
accurately represent the physical and emotional discomfort that 
can 
be anticipated 
when 
someone 
is in your office who
 

y
ou think is going to be a danger to you or a 
potential danger to the school.

 
He recounted an incident during the previous year 
in his former school when the principal 
had 
felt it necessary to 
lock the 
doors 
betwe
en the workroom and her office 
for her own 
protection in the event that she 
felt endangered by an angry parent. He confessed that he always felt 

under the 
gun

 
anticipating just such a crisis with a threatening parent and 
acknowledged 
that 
it might be useful for leaders to learn 
some procedural th
ings
 
to deal with 
these situations.
 
Induction 
Into 
the Role of Assistant Principal
 
District support for new assistant principals. 
In assigning Roger to a 
school as a new AP, his 
district leaders had
 
intentionally matched
 
his skills 
with 
those of his princi
pal. He expressed surprise that someone in Leadership Services 
had considered them a good fit because he 
considered 
his administrative partner 
a 

physical 
education
 
type

 
of 
person 
who was involved in 
sports and himself as 
the exact opposite, more academic
 
and bookish. 
However, as the year progressed
 
Roger began to 
accept 
the decision because it seemed to him that their 
abilities 
were 
complementary, 
which resulted
 
in a fairly stable administrative relationship.
 
114
 
 
New understandings of leadership.
 
In the posit
ion of AP, Roger aspired 
to a leadership approach 
centered on developing respectful and trusting 
relationships with 
the 
teaching staff. Such a leader, he felt, made concerted efforts 
to be visible to staff and students and did not hold what Roger called th
at 

positional thing

 
over others or curb individual autonomy. As well, he or she 
trusted teachers to act professionally and did not feel the need to watch or 
supervise staff at all times. Roger struggled, however, with the enactment of this 
type of relati
onal approach to leadership because he did not want to be perceived 
as 
a 

pushover
,

 
which
 
suggested 
to him 
a relationship with teachers in which he 

rescued

 
and 

fixed

 
their problems as a result of his kind nature.
 
During his first months at Padre Pio S
chool, Roger noticed that as an AP 
he 
had become a 

go
-
to

 
person, which he considered more akin to a manage
r
 
than 
a 

real

 
leader. He
 
cited as an example instances when teachers sent students 
to the office to be disciplined for 
being 
repeatedly unprepared
 
for class 
or 
disruptive. Roger felt that t
his kind of disciplinary action

an administrator

s
 
dealing with a teacher

s classroom management problems

diminished the 
teacher

s authority. He contended that teacher
s
 
are 
in charge of 
their 
classroom
s
 
and ought 
to take responsibility to 

carve out their own area

 
and authority by 
preparing a plan of 
action to help students succeed.
 
This 
is what he understood 
as 
leadership. Roger recalled his own proactive strategies as a classroom teacher and 
maintained that his 
job as the teacher 
was 
to keep 
the students 
accountable and 
working 
to a standard. Other examples that supported Roger

s belief that his AP 
role had become more managerial were occasions when teachers required him to 
115
 
 

drop everything [as an administrator] 
in order to deal with [their] situation,

 
which at times meant taking over their classes as they dealt with personal issues. 
He bemoaned their lack of 
anticipation of
 
such occasions and 
lack of 
arrangements
 
for replacement teacher
s
 
because his time then be
came 
unproductive.
 
Roger understood l
eadership as the ability to 

direct people, to bring them 
to a point where they might be able to do things on their own.

 
The principal at 
Padre Pio School reinforced this 
type of leadership model 
and 
delegated tasks or
, 
as Roger described it, literally 

made the reality.

 
In the school power flowed 
from the 
top down
,
 
and Roger remarked that teachers and APs expected this kind 
of structure. 
Using a metaphor to shed light on his image of an educational leader, 
Roger compa
red 
the role of a principal
 
to the head 
chef of a restaurant as on the 
television reality show 

Ramsay

s Kitchen Nightmares.

 
He imagined 
that 
his 
head chef would not be 

nasty

 
as 
Ramsay 
is, 
but possess 
the 
qualities 
of more 
of 
a 

benevolent dictator,

 
wh
ich means
 
that he would be compassionate and
 
firm in 
carrying out his vision of leadership, but that he would always 
be 
the one in 
charge. This image, he felt, also involved a complex 

relationship
-
based thing
,

 
with many sous
-
chefs (department heads) in c
harge of different areas under the 
direction of the head chef (p
rincipal/leader). Roger believes
 
that 
i
f the people 
with 
who
m
 
the principal 
work
s
 
trust in 
his or her 
ability to guide, that they will 

give 
[him or her] 
a lot more slack

 
when 
it is required
.
 
Throughout his first year in the AP role,
 
Roger participated in his district

s 
10 
mandatory 
one
-
and
-
a
-
half
-
hour meetings. He explained that 
TCSD

s 
116
 
 
Leadership Services 
organized and facilitated 
these sessions 
with an agenda that 
the new APs had 
partially 
s
et 
themselves. 
The s
essions included topics such as the 
district handbook, legal responsibilities, teacher supervision and
 
evaluation, 
coding for special
-
needs students, and Catholic social teachings. Roger 
considered 
the sessions worthwhile but 
suggested 
that he would have benefited 
more 
from developing
 
collegial relationships during this time, especially by 
sharing experiences with other new secondary
-
level APs. He restated his desire 
for more information on 
how to deal
 
with conflict situations.
 
New and c
hallenging situations. 
Roger

s induction into his new role as an 
AP had a fairly significant impact on his confidence. He did not know any of the 
staff members at the school when he first arrived, and because he was 
inexperienced as an administrator, 
he 
fe
lt a little daunted 
by 
the staff

s frequent
 

peppering

 
with questions and expecting 
immediate 
answers to their urgent 
problems. He intimated that the pressure of having to make immediate decisions 
made him feel
 
isolated
 
in his office. This situation was e
xacerbated when his 
principal was absent from the building because Roger did not have anyone else in 
the school with whom to consult. At times
,
 
however, if the situation warranted, 
Roger would also telephone one of his previous principals for advice to con
fer 
with him 
or to confirm his choice of actions.
 
In 
his 
first 
year 
as an 
AP
,
 
Roger realized the extent of the tension 
of 
administrator
s

 
exposure
 
to difficult situations and the i
mplications of acting on 
them
. Very early in 
his 
AP
 
position, Roger learned 
that not all of his decisions as 
an administrator were acceptable to 
the 
staff, and this was a problem 
for him 
117
 
 
because he came 

from a family that wants to please.

 
Consequently, he was 
working on an approach to help
ing
 
people come to terms with 
their 
deci
sions. 
Roger described a recent problem 
that 
arose at a staff meeting regarding his 
principal

s proposal to adopt a cumulative approach to assessment. 
He 
pointed out 
that 
a great deal 
of 

collateral damage

 
had resulted
 
from 
the 
heated discussions 
on this 
issue between the principal and 
the 
math and science
 
teachers
. The 
combative edge 
of 
this meeting felt distinctly un
-
Catholic and
,
 
consequently
,
 
very 
un
comfortable for him. He believes
 
that, 
because 
his principal was being 
evaluated that year (his second) 
and because the evaluation process required 
interviews with staff members, the principal 

capitulated

 
and withdrew his 
proposal.
 
Roger also 
faced 
tension as a new administrator 
in 
his role as a s
upervisor 
of teachers. 
On one 
occasion 
when a staff member c
hallenged 
his authority
,
 
he 
found it difficult to confront this person. 
He considered this 
a fairly low
-
level 
incident in which a teacher 
had 
repeatedly neglected his hallway supervision 
duties 
that 
he or she 
shared 
with Roger 
every Friday morning. When ot
her adults 
in the school were not doing their jobs, he approached the situation with humour 
and kindness and usually did not 
face 
problems from them again. Roger explained 
that this particular strategy had not completely worked with the offending teacher
,
 
and the issue was currently unresolved. His attempts to build a better relationship 
with the teacher had been unsuccessful
,
 
and he admitted that
,
 

quite honestly,

 
he 
was unsure of other procedures for dealing with problem adults.

On Becoming a New Assista
nt Principal: 
The 
Case of Maxine
 
Background and Context
 
In 2007
 
Maxine became a first
-
year 
AP
 
at Assumption Junior High 
School, 
which is 
part of TCSD. Approximately 150 students attended Assumption 
School in 
Grades
 
7 to 9 that year, 
and the school had 
11 t
eachers and 4 support 
staff. The sc
hool is located in a mid
-
socio
economic area in a suburban 
neighbourhood.
 
Maxine gravitated towards the teaching profession as a result of her 
experiences as a playground instructor over 
several 
years when she was a 
teenag
er. In this role she developed skills to successfully organize and to engage 
children in a variety of recreational activities. Because 
Maxine

s family high
ly
 
value
s
 
postsecondary education, she studied for a Bachelor of Education 
degree 
as 
an elementary sp
ecialist
 
and graduated
 
in 1983. For 15 years she taught 
elementary
-
aged children 
in 
TCSD until her secondment as a project coordinator 
in 2000 to a provincial body whose focus was health and physical education. In 
1983, during her secondment, she 
earned a 
master

s 
degree in 
e
lementary 
educa
tion at a provincial university; her thesis 
was 
on teaching and motivating 
elementary
-
aged girls to be physically active.
 
Maxine then 
taught 
physical 
education in a large junior high school, again within TCSD, for three y
ears before 
she became 
an AP.
 
Preparation for the Administrative Role
 
Maxine believes
 
that her preparation for the AP role began when she 
became a teacher because she sought opportunities to engage in 
leadership roles 
119
 
 
within the school. She further honed h
er planning and organizational skills as a 
coach of sports teams and an organizer of special events for students and staff. As 
well, Maxine participated on a variety of different provincial and local 
committees and 
had 
diverse roles and responsibilities. S
he perceived 
rapport and 
relationship as key to teaching and leading.
 
Maxine

s
 
three
-
year 
secondment by a provincial body to coordinate 
curriculum and a variety of projects for teachers
 
prepared her for the role of 
administrator
. In this position she desig
ned and implemented workshops on 
student physical involvement for K
-
12 teachers in collaboration with school 
districts and groups of teachers. She also acquired more traditional adminis
trative 
skills:
 
I had staff; I had a secretary; I had newsletters to wr
ite. I was accountable 
for a budget
,
 
so I had to manage the program. I traveled. I collaborated 
with a number of different associations, so I had my hand in lots of 
different things that were going on. I had to plan massive events; I had to 
plan little eve
nts.
 
In 2004 Maxine participated 
in her district

s leadership formation and 
training program. She considered this professional development a step forward 
towards leadership. These sessions, she pointed out, touched the surface o
f
 
what 
the AP role 
involves
 
and enhanced her understanding of leadership within a 
Catholic context.
 
Induction 
Into 
the Role of Assistant Principal
 
District support for new assistant principals.
 
Like Roger, Maxine 
at
tended all of TCSD

s mandatory one
-
and
-
a
-
half
-
hour sessions for first
-
year 
APs. Although 
she 
appreciated the pertinence of much of the information 
that the 
120
 
 
district 
presented to beginning APs, she was disappointed when these same 
presentations were repeated throughout the year at the larger district sessions for 
AP
s. Maxine
 
found that hearing the same information again became a source of 
added stress considering the increased demands on her time at school. She 
suggested that a 
better 
approach to AP preparation might have included a 
concerted focus on the area of 
principals

 
mentorship
 
of APs
. Although she felt 
that she had a strong partnership with her principal, Maxine remarked that they 
often lacked opportunities to sit down and 

really talk.

 
She thought that it would 
greatly 
increase APs

 
contextual understanding 
if their
 
mentor principal
s
 
attended 
the 
district sessions to discuss the various topics.
 
New understandings of leadership.
 
When she 
assumed 
the role, 
Maxine 
viewed 
educational leadership as shaped within the social context of her 
relationship to the world, her imm
ediate community, and her family. 
New APs 
also extrapolate the q
ualities of leadership, she 
added, 
from 
the 
direct and 
vicarious experiences of teachers and government leaders, with the ultimate aim 
of 

becoming better people.

 
With regard to 
creating a me
taphor for 
her 
work 
with her staff, 
Maxine

s 
first response was to compare the administrative leader to 
the coach of an Olympics team. She compared some of her teaching staff to 
athlete
s
 
who 
a
re 

out there
 
trying

 
and working hard, facing
 
all sorts of 
chal
lenges. She commented that
, as a coach, she tries
 
to build on teachers

 
strengths by gradually addressing the
ir
 
weakness

for example, in their 
understanding of curriculum

and attending to their relationships with students 
121
 
 
and even 
among 
themselves. Maxine 
saw herself as taking on an encourager or 
builder
 
role with he
r staff:
 
It

s almost lik
e [being] a construction worker. You

re 
building a frame
,
 
and you

re trying to put all the good stuff forward and being as honest as 
you can, as
 
helpful as you can, to pr
oblem
-
solve. Coach just seemed to be 
a good fit.
 
Good 
leader
s
 
overall, 
Maxine 
summarized, 
are those who embody
 
sincerity and honesty in 
their 
relationships with the community, 
are 
very child
 
centered, and 
invest
 
time and energy in
 
problem
-
solving. For
 
her
,
 
a strong leader 
is exemplified in the qualities of her principal. Foremost, he value
s relationships 
and overtly cares
 
for stud
ents in the way that he listens to them and treats
 
them 
with dignity and fairness. She regarded him as a 

fine role model

 
who 
ex
emplifies
 
a Christ
-
centered focus 
on 
student discipline. Maxine
 
reported
 
that 
this approach 
has 
guided her in bringing out something positive in every 
interaction with student
s
, no matter the reason 
that 
they were in the office, and 
that it 
has 
led to posi
tive individual growth for them.
 
New and challenging situations. 
Maxine felt that her role as an AP began 
as a trial by fire. She 
had 

jumped into something for the very first time

 
and then 
needed
 
the conf
idence to 

just wade through it

:
 
We had a student
 
die. How 
do you deal with that in your school? Your 
first situation with kids with drugs, your first situation with physical 
fighting, trying to understand your boundaries within your context and 
getting to know kids, staff, expectations of your colleague
s, expectations 
of the principal

your partner. Dealing with weak and disempowered staff 
members: I have been in uncomfortable staff situations where I have been 
faced with helping to resolve conflict between parents, student
s
, and staff 
where I haven

t bee
n involved in the context of the situation
.
 
.
 
.
 
.
 
Having 
to adopt different protocols and different traditions already honoured in 
the school that irritated my own belief system. I challenged the action plan 
122
 
 
system the first day that I saw it; I shared tha
t I was uncomfortable with it, 
but I was asked to give it a try and go through with it anyway.
 
At times 
Maxine felt 
that the staff 
misunderstood 
her 
decisions on how to 
best handle a situation 
with a student, especially when the
 
staff

s
 
expectations 
were d
ifferent 
from 
her own. She explained that because administrators have the 
opportunity to spend time with students to 
understand the situation
, they have a 
more global view of 
their 
circumstances
;
 
for example, parents 
who have 
separated
, drug rehabilitation
, and academic struggles. Maxine pointed out that 
many students were 
attending 
school with more 

on their plate

 
than 
the 
teachers 
realized and that she liked to have that 

extra bit of power and control to make a 
decision that would affect a student

 
in w
hat she knew 

to be a good way.

 
Maxine spent much of her time guiding teachers who 
became 
frustrated 
with inattentive students. She commented on the advice of a presenter at a recent 
workshop on troubled youth who 
advised 
that it 
is 
more important 
for tea
chers 
to 
connect with 
their 
children before 
they begin to 
direct their thinking. In other 
words, 

If 
[teachers] don

t have [students

] hearts, [they] don

t have their minds

;
 
therefore, 
it is 

that much harder for students to learn.

 
She also recognized th
at 
she has
 
to 
carefully 
select the issues 
that she chooses to address because she 
appreciates
 
that change in school culture 
is 
often a slow process.
 
Maxine acknowledged that she 
assumed 
the AP role knowing that it would 
be multifaceted, but she did not exp
ect the great extent to which she would be 

stretched.

 
She 
faced 
many highs and lows in dealing with circumstances 
associated with the AP role. Although she had improved her skills over the past 
several months in nearly all aspects of scho
ol
-
community
 
lea
dership
, the impact 
123
 
 
of becoming an AP had frequently 

compromised

 
Maxine

s sleep and her level 
of energy. 
Her 
constant thinking took up 

more headspace
,

 
and she 
acknowledged the possibility of burnout 
from 
her continuous self
-
reflection., 
Maxine describe
d herself as being on 

show

 
most of the time
 
when she was a 
teacher
, but 
she was also 
physically more active and involved with
 
the students
. 
S
he 
was concerned that in 
her current role as an AP
 
she was in danger of
 
mental 
exhaustion.
 
In chapter five I desc
ribed 
TCSD

s 
leadership training programs and the 
ways in which this district structured the experience of their first
-
year 
AP
s. The 
cases of Roger and Maxine, two beginning APs, presented their backgrounds, 
their preparation 
for their respective administr
ative roles, and their interpretation 
of
 
their induction into the role.
 
Chapter six 
includes an analysis of 
the three AP participants

 
enactment of
 
TCSD

s and MCSD

s 
discursive practices.

CHAPTER SIX:
 
NEGOTIATI
NG AUTHORITATIVE AND INTERNALLY
 
PERSUASIVE DI
SCOURS
ES OF LEADERSHIP
 
IN
 
BECOMING AN ASSISTANT PRINCIPAL
 
Revisiting the Research Question
 
This case study focused
 
on new 
AP
s

 
experience
s 
in 
becoming educational 
leaders. How do these educators from diverse experiential backgrounds negotiate 
personally pe
rsuasive and authoritative discourses in fashioning their identities to 
become 
AP
s in two Catholic school districts? I draw upon
 
Deborah Britzman

s 
(2003) question of identity formation in learning to teach
. She cited
 
Willard 
Waller

s (1961) question 
about
 
what teaching 
does 
to a teacher. My question is
,
 
What 
does 
leading
 
do to a leader
?
 
What is it like to become an 
AP
? The three 
beginning APs in my study encounter many conflicts 
between 
specific 
authoritative discourses and their internally persuasive disc
ourses as they 
negotiate their identities as educational leaders.
 
In chapters four and five I interpreted the narratives of these participants 
who are trying to balance 
others

 
expectations of what they should do as leaders 
with their own beliefs. 
They con
veyed t
hese beliefs in 
their 
accounts of 
their 
preparation 
for the administrative role, their experiences with leadership, and the 
types of conflicts 
that they 
encounter
ed
 
as 
new 
APs. The expectations of who new 
APs should be as leaders are the authoritati
ve discourses that 
circulate
 
in 
school 
districts, school communities, and the mainstream literature on leadership.
 
125
 
 
I
 
begi
n this chapter by reviewing the negotiation between authoritative and 
personally persuasive discourses and the process of negotiation t
hat is part of our 
ideological becoming (Bakhtin, 1981). Then I focus on the 
tension
 
that 
the 
participants 
faced 
in their negotiation of three central areas: confl
icting discourses 
of leadership,
 
the dissonance between the challenges 
between 
and affirmatio
ns 
of 
their 
deeply held values and the traditional institutional demands of 
administration
,
 
and
,
 
finally, 
the conflict 
between role expec
tations and 
autonomous decision 
making. 
In chapter seven I will discuss m
y conclusions and 
the implications 
of 
the 
tens
ion
 
that the 
new 
AP
s in the study 
faced
.
 
Negoti
ating Personally Persuasive and 
Au
thoritative
 
Discourses of Leadership
 
Becoming an AP disturbs 
the 
familiar identities of teachers
 
who enter 
educational administration. The acquisition of leadership skills and
 
exposure to a 
variety of experiences push new APs to a deeper awareness of the general concept 
of leading. However, beginning APs also 
assume
 
the administrative role with their 
own understandings and expectations of what it means to be a leader. Their 
per
sonally persuasive discourses can be at variance with the authoritative 
discourses of leadership 
that circulate
 
within the school community.
 
The findings 
of 
this research study focus on the challenges and conflicts 
between specific authoritative discourses
 
and my participants

 
personally 
persuasive discourses as they negotiate their identities as APs. For the new APs in 
the study, these challenges and conflicts primarily involved negotiating three 
major areas: the conflicting discourses of leadership 
that t
hey encounter,
 
the 
126
 
 
challenges 
to 
and affirmations 
of 
deeply held values and 
the 
traditional 
institutional demands of a
dministration,
 
and
 
compliance with existing authorities 
and the exercising of autonomous power and authority. The experiences of these 
thr
ee first
-
year 
AP
s inevitably overlap as their narratives 
weave through 
these 
themes; however, each theme offers a unique perspective of the discourses that 
they negotiate
 
to fashion AP identities.
 
Conflicting Understandings of Leadership 
Within 
School Dist
ricts
 
 
Various authoritative discourses of leadership 
circulate
 
in training 
programs for aspiring leaders (
e.g., 
top
-
down management and collaborative 
leadership in 
TCSD
 
and the neo
liberal business practices in 
MCSD
). These 
authoritative discourses 
conflic
t 
not only with one another, but also with some of 
the internally persuasive discourses of aspiring leaders in a Catholic school 
system. One implication of these conflicting understandings of leadership for 
those 
who become
 
new leaders centers on the expec
tations of the school 
community 
with regard to
 
the role of the educational leader that
 
pre
date
 
the 
AP
s

 
arrival. 
They 
also 
have 
implicat
ions for the development of their 
identity as 
leader
s
 
in a system that emphasizes preparation for the le
adership role ov
er 
acknowledgement of the
 
impact on the self.
 
 
The participants 
perceive 
leadership in terms of the authoritative 
discourses as multidimensional and
,
 
to some extent, confusing and contradictory. 
The province

s Ministry of Education, for example, 
identified
 
seven dimensions 
of good 
leader
s,
 
including
 
the ability to build relationships, be visionary, develop
 
le
adership in others, and manage
 
school operations and resources. MCSD 
bases 
127
 
 
its evaluation of
 
administrators 
on 
similar
 
traits
, but organizes them into 
three 
major areas of leadership: cultural, instructional, and managerial/organizational. 
TCSD categorizes 
its 
evaluation criteria in the same way, but 
with slightly 
different wording: It uses
 
the
 
word 
religious
 
rather than 
cultural
. These 
dimensions and ev
aluation criteria from the two school boards describe leadership 
behaviours
,
 
but they do not explain understandings of leadership in terms of the 
hierarchical power structures that exist in schools
 
or the influence of neo
liberal 
discourses that shape polic
ies of governments or how these elements interact with 
authoritative discourses of Catholic education. The 
next section discusses the 
experience of 
the 
participants and their negotiation of these authoritative 
discourses.
 
Understandings of Hierarchical Pow
er Structures
 
TCSD, the sc
hool district of first
-
year APs
 
Maxine and Roger, is rooted in 
a traditional authoritative discourse of autonomous leadership that structure
s
 
educational leaders as self
-
sufficient, independent, and personally autonomous. 
This app
roach to leadership develops the principal into a leader who is solely 
accountable for the operation of the school with respect to the school budget, 
staffing, and student programming. However, in the past 
20
 
years the TCSD

s
 
principal role has been shifti
ng to encompass building a school culture 
that 
encourages and emphasize
s
 
teamwork and staff participation 
and develop
ing
 
the 
leadership capacity 
of 
students, staff, and parents
. The
 
leadership training 
program calls attention to concepts of teacher leaders
hip that encourage a shared 
power construct. The principal, caught in transition, is simultaneously positioned 
128
 
 
as the head of a hierarchical structure and as the one 
who is 
primarily responsible 
for fostering effective relationships within the school. It i
s no surprise that the 
existing tension between autonomous discourses of leadership and leadership 
discourses that are founded on relationship account for much of the confusion 
over 
how a leader should act.

leadership that circulate to form educational leaders, two of 
which are 
discourses

of control for the leader, ranging from 
having 
considerable power over othe
rs to 
sharing considerable power with others. 
However, new APs in the field do not 
easily negotiate t
he spread.
 
Roger, for example, interpreted
 
his AP role 
as 
primarily hierarchical, but also 
noted that it involves
 
some level of relat
ionship 
with staff tha
t depends
 
on the leader

s personality. He underst
ood
 
a school 
leader

s power 
as 
generally flow
ing
 
from the 
top
 
down
 
and believes
 
that teachers 
and APs expect
 
this kind of st
ructure. His choice of metaphor

the leader as the 
head chef of a restaurant

reflect
s
 
this approach because the relationship with 
others in the kitchen 
is 
clearly hierarchical.
 
For Roger, however, the ideal leader 
is 
also a 

benevolent dictator

 
whose 
actions are autonomous and principled, yet whose authority is infused with a 
sense of ge
nerosity and adherence to 
Catholic
 
principles (unlike the head chef 
129
 
 
Ramsay) 
with regard to
 
his or her relationship
s with others. Roger understood 
the 
principal

s autonomy as the right to delegate tasks and to literally 

make the 
reality

 
in the school. Eng
lish (1994) would agree that concepts of the leader as 
autonomous, with traits and skills that make him or her uniquely qualified and in 
control, and 
as one 
who makes principled decisions on behalf of an organization 
or group, continue to 

inform current a
ttitudes

 
(p.
 
137) in education today. 
Leadership, however, constructed in this way as independent
 
and separate from 
followership
 
misleads the actual role 
of 
followers within the leader
-
follower 
relationship. For Roger, the role of followers requires some 
level of consultation 
with them as part of a collaborative or shared leadership model in the school. The 
relational leader, therefore, according to Roger, is one who exhibits sensitivity to 
others by taking into consideration the needs of those in the scho
ol 
in 
making 
decisions, but who is ultimately an 
autonomous decision 
maker. In dealing with 
difficult staff members, Maxine would agree with Roger

s assessment that 
benevolence is important; her relationship with her principal, however, seems to 
have been 
less hierarchical and a much more collaborative leadership experience 
between the two administrators.
 
It may have 
seemed 
to Roger 
that 
decisions 
are 
made in a hierarchical and 
autonomous manner because of TCSD

s practice 
with regard to
 
the role of the 
prin
cipal (i.e.
,
 
the principal as primarily responsible for the operation of the 
school). However, Roger was also begin
ning to recognize that decision 
making 
can 
be a messy and uncomfortable process 
that requires
 
negotiation and 
conciliation with all staff. He
 
was discovering that administrators cannot be 
130
 
 
effective leaders if they operate autonomously in spite of the bureaucratic 
structure of the role. Although he acknowledged that it 
is 
important for the 
administrator to develop solid working relationships wit
h staff and students to 
engender their cooperation and enable a healthy
,
 
functioning school, it was yet 
unclear to him how this was to happen. In TCSD

s leadership programs, both APs 
had 
read 
literature on building collaborative school cultures, with a hea
vy 
emphasis on teacher leadership models. A relational approach to leadership 
interrupts the hierarchical organization 
with 
the principal

s
 
position
 
at the top as 
the solo leader. It requires the principal

s commitment to develop teachers and 
welcome their
 
expert
ise as participants in decision 
making through structures such 
as school
-
based professional learning communities (Lambert, 2003). It also 
requires learning skills to 
give the 
staff the necessary tools to work effectively as 
a team 
and 
enable to prin
cipal 
to let go 
with respect to holding power. 
Turning 
this theory 
into 
practice is aggravated by the slow change to 
the 
existing 
structures
, which
 
creates ambiguity and confusion
,
 
particularly for those new to 
the job.
 
The relationship between autonomous 
and relational discourses became 
problematic for Roger especially when his principal was absent from the school 
and Roger was expected to attend to emergent issues. He was not at all confident 
that he would know what to do on these occasions because he did
 
not perceive 
himself as the 

real

 
leader
,
 
and he rued his lack of strategies to deal with conflict 
situations. This tension may have rendered his identity as an educational leader 
more vulnerable and contributed to his feeling, at times, more anxious and
 
less 
131
 
 
effective as an administrator. His uncertainty also generated a sense of isolation in 
the role, which was exacerbated by his initial hesitation to establish relationships 
with 
the 
staff. Although he admire
s
 
educational leader
s who trust
 
teachers to a
ct 
professionally and 
give staff the autonomy they need
 
to perform their work, as a 
new administrator himself, he found 
that 
the complexity of establishing these 
kinds of relationships 
is 
not at all easy to work through.
 
Influence of Neo
liberal Policies
 
Ro
ger

s understandings of leadership as a new AP generally centered on 
issues of power and control, whereas 
when 
Brian 
assumed an administrative role, 
he 
understood leadership 
as 
collaborative and instructional. 
However, 
Brian

s 
district, MCSD, 
adhered to 
le
adership practices that were influenced by neoliberal 
discourses in 
its 
attempt to maximize resources in a school system that was 
stretched to capacity. To become a 

good

 
educational leader in MCSD, Brian 
outwardly (and sincerely) consented to this author
itative discourse, but his 
internally persuasive voice was not so certain.
 
Brian

s district introduced several leadership practices that were tied to a 
research
-
based management consulti
ng firm and incorporated these
 
marketplace 
discourses into the very fo
undation of the district. Britzman (2003) pointed out 
that such discourses become powerful when they are 

institutionally sanctioned

 
(p.
 
39). MCSD

s business relationship with the Gallup
 
Organization
, which I 
described in 
c
hapter 
four
, was justified in tw
o of the district goals 
identified 
in 
its 
AERR
 
for 2007
-
2008. The goals supported the implementation of Gallup 
resources to 

build
 
engaged schools

 
(Gallup
 
Inc.
,
 
2009d
, p.
 
1
) and 
validate
d
 
the 
132
 
 
staff
-
selection process 
by 
using Gallup

s
 
online tools. MCSD

s 
attempt to 
ascertain the most salient traits of 
its 
administrators to guarantee a better 
administrativ
e team fit reflects a science
-
like approach to control the very human 
dynamic of compatibility. Additionally, the practice of determining exact 
leadership
 
traits and a correct administrative match is anchored in a discourse that 
judges quality and establishes the worth of individuals. Both of these factors 
reflect a shift in authoritative discourses that push educational decisions more 
towards the adoption 
of private business practices for economic purposes 
(Wallace, 2004).
 
Brian became a new 
AP
 
in a school district in which he was also a new 
employee with no previous experiences or relationships with its members. He had 
not been part of the complex process 
that had generated his district

s decision to 
hire the Gallup 
Organization 
as part of 
its 
school reform. Accordingly, he was not 
in a position to voice his concerns or to be critical of an unfamiliar structure 
that 
was operating to shape his identity as an
 
educational leader 
in 
MCSD. In his new 
role he was more inclined to assimilate his district

s leadership practices that were 
rooted in authoritative discourses of the market, but in the process his compliance 
generated an internal conflict 
over 
some of it
s structures. For example, Brian 
found that Gallup tools, such as online testing that ranks the profile of prospective 
employees, may not serve its purpose of identifying the right person for the job.
 
In spite of Gallup

s promise of an exact process in hir
ing the
 
right 
teachers, Brian questioned
 
the use of the ranking system as the only variable in 
assessing a teacher

s potential as an effective staff member. The measure of 
133
 
 
strengths 
that 
MCSD 
used 
to guide leader selection and placement was 
also 
not 
partic
ularly useful 
in 
Brian

s work as an AP. In spite of the district

s selection of 
Brian as the 

right

 
match for his principal, he still found himself caught up in 
uncertainty and unpredictability in his new role. Knowing his strengths and being 
appropriatel
y matched 
with 
another administrator did not mitigate the conflicts 
that were part of Brian

s first year as an 
AP
. 
They 
did not resolve the problem of 
needing more mentorship and feedback, nor did
 
they
 
ease the hard work of 
developing relationships with st
aff and students. Brian had invested a great deal 
of time before and after 
he became 
an AP in constructing himself as an 

educational

 
leader, but
,
 
ironically, through Gallup, his district has pegged him 
as a 

learner,

 
which was a match 
with 
his principal

s talent as a 

developer.

 
Previously, as a teacher and a student studying for a 
m
aster

s degree, Brian 
had heavily focused on organizing professional development activities for others 
in his district. He strove to develop staff during his first months as
 
an AP
,
 
to the 
extent that he personally released teachers from class 
to allow 
them to collaborate. 
At some point it will likely become problematic for Brian to ascertain how he 
might move beyond this particular label as a 

learner

 
and possibly beyond the
 
confines of the Gallup program to become a developer and sanctioned 
instructional leader himself. One of the ambiguities of the leadership scale 
that 
the 
Gallup program 
uses 
is 
the permanence of the categories 
that 
define leadership 
strengths. Although th
ere is merit in exploring correlations between an educator

s 
strengths and the impact on his or her self
-
understanding and performance as an 
educational leader, there is a danger in using 
these 
data primarily to inform how 
134
 
 
leadership roles should 
function 
in schools. If these categories do not change over 
time, I wonder to what extent these strengths will ultimately define a person

s 
performance and identity as an administrator with MCSD. This opens up 
questions 
about new APs

 
values and beliefs that come i
nto conflict within 
institutional settings and how 
they then negotiate 
these ethics.
 
Values and Traditional Institutional Demands of Administrat
ion
 
The first
-
year 
as 
an AP requires a negotiation among personally persuasive 
discourses of community and colle
gial relationships and institutional expectations 
of leadership, as was largely the case with all three participants, Maxine, Roger, 
and Brian. These three new APs experienced challenges 
to 
and affirmations 
of 
their deeply held values as they came up again
st the traditional institutional 
demands of administration. An implication for educational leaders 
who 
quest
ion
 
or 
repress
 
their values because of institutional demands that appear to be more 
pressing and immediate is 
the
 
move towards compromising an ethic
 
of care for 
others. Being challenged by institutional expectations may also engender a 
reluctance to speak out or to critique existing structures when 
leaders encounter 
injustices or compromising situations.
 
Becoming an AP in an en
vironment that embraced 
neo
liberal practices, as 
I 
mentioned in the previous section, potential
ly
 
challenge Brian

s 
understanding 
of 
leading. He 
felt 
more comfortable as the type of educational leader who ably 
facilitates instructional practices that directly impact teaching in t
he classroom, 
and he expressed a mistrust of the kind of leader whom he called 

transformational.

 
His understanding of transformational leader
s
 
is 
of 
those who 
135
 
 
take
 
district
s
 
into 

new realms of education that are going on out there

 
and 
leave 
a 

never
-
la
sting peace

 
in their wake. Brian

s district had already moved into that 
realm
,
 
and it is possible that his choice of words subconsciously reflected his 
concern that the district had adopted practices that, in 
the 
future, might be 
problematic for himself a
nd his colleagues. In fact, 
when they were interviewed, 
the 
district personnel at MCSD were consistently focused on the implementation 
of their initiative to build engaged schools. 
They generally connected their 
discussion 
of 
Catholic values and beliefs ba
ck to t
he long
-
term plans for 
district
wide improvement. A district leader frequently described
 
t
he authoritative 
discourses of Cat
holic leadership that influence
 
the district as highly compatible 
with the Gallup approach because the organization and the in
stitution each stress a 
focus on developing talents; in the latter

s case, talents are considered 

God
-
given.

 
It is more likely, however, that the benefits of using Gallup

s services and 
resources are closely related to efficiency and increased performanc
e and that a 
connection with nobler purposes is merely convenient. The effects of the 
relationship between the Gallup 
Organization 
and MCSD

s Catholic values would 
certainly be interesting to revisit in 
the 
future.
 
Maxine and Roger

s school district, TCSD,
 
like MCSD and other school 
boards 
in the province 
over the past 
20 
years, had also been forced to make 
difficult economic decisions in response to government restructuring movem
ents 
in education (Levin, 200
1)
 
and subsequent budgetary constraints (Taylor, 
2001; 
Young, 2002). Education, in general, has become more market
-
like to counter 
government
-
fuel
l
ed perceptions of schools 
as 
failing to produce students 
who are 
136
 
 
prepared for the work
force (
Levin, 
2001;
 
Taylor, 2001). This perception has 
shifted values 
th
at favour
 
the public good to values that 
a
re more rooted in the 
marketplace. Consequently, school districts 
have 
leaned towards more 
performance
-
based discourses 
that 
normalize the performances of individuals or 
organizations as measures of productivity or
 
displays of quality
,
 
and 
then 
calculate and commodify 
these measures. For example, the discourses taken up by 
TCSD had their genesis in the Ministry of Education

s demands for increased 
performance that were authorized by the province

s 2003 Commission on
 
Learning (Alberta Education, 2003). The Commission

s vision affirmed education 
as the most 

important investment a society can make

 
and underlined the 
importance of judging the success of schools and the education system by 

how 
well every child learns

 
(p.
 
4). To this end, it prescribed the use of performance 
measures to monitor its execution. A school

s operational tasks that now included 
significant accountability measures were downloaded from district offices 
such as 
those in TCSD to local schools and
 
school principals. Administrators were 
compelled to focus more on productivity, operating costs, and budgets at the 
expense of the transmission of culture and identity development. TCSD appeared 
to be very much aware of the subsequent erosion of Catholic 
culture and 
discourses and took up professional development activities in attempts to resist 
and slow down this incursion of a performance focus.
 
Maxine

s school was small in siz
e and had a high number of special
-
needs 
students, an overtaxed staff, and lim
ited economic resources. In her first months 
as an AP, Maxine coped with a large number of difficult situations that tested her 
137
 
 
resolve to be compassionate and fair. These 
included the death of a student;
 
problems with drugs, violence
,
 
and fighting
;
 
a weak
 
and disempowered staff
;
 
and 
a discipline policy that she described as 

irritating [her] own beliefs

 
because of 
its unfairness to students. Maxine also contended with 
difficult 
staff situations 
that 
involved
 
teacher
s

 
conflicts with parents. Encountering 
the overwhelming 
complexity of the educational administrator

s world, Maxine realized the 
limitations of her ability to exercise personal control. 
The extensive demands of 
the school hampered h
er desire to take a compassionate approach to the problems 
she 
encountered. However, she found support from her principal
,
 
who shared her 
values and who was equally dedicated to taking the time needed to address the 
school

s issues.
 
The leadership practices of both Maxine and her principal were rooted in 
Gospel values
, but they felt constrained by limited resources as they operated in a 
school environment that came with an abundance of needs and tight fiscal 
constraints. For Maxine, to be a 

good

 
AP in these surroundings included a 
desire and willingness to commit as 
much t
ime as was necessary to completing
 
all 
tasks in a timely way to be an effective administrator. She claimed that the payoff 
for the energy 
that 
she put into this position was 
her 
increased ability to advocate 
for students with the extra bit of power a
nd authority that came with the 
administrative role. However, the effort required to solve problems that pre
dated
 
her arrival 
at 
the school, problems that could not easily be solved, along with the 
effort needed to maintain a high degree of commitment to s
tudents, came with a 
cost to the self. Maxine acknowledged that she constantly thought about her job 
138
 
 
when she was away from the school and at times lost sleep over the many 
decisions 
that she had to make
. Her personal philosophy of well
-
being was more 
diff
icult to maintain within an environment of the conflicting authoritative 
discourses of Catholic leadership and performativity.
 
Maxine

s efforts to encourage wellness in her staff took precedence over 
her own need for balance. In the process of negotiating 
her identity as an 
AP
, 
Maxine strongly affirmed 
her district

s 
authoritative discourses of Catholic 
leadership
,
 
but she set aside the warning of her inner voice to be more critical of 
what this job was demanding of her. Her internally persuasive discourse 
was not 
open to challenging the tremendous tasks that she had embraced. In other words, 
this intense effort was integral to her understanding of what a good leader does in 
spite of its potential to be detrimental to her own well
-
being. Both authoritative 
d
iscourses form leaders from whom much is demanded. Catholic discourses 
develop leaders who are encouraged to provide a high level of care and service to 
others (Groome, 1998), and a leader shaped by performance discourses demands 
that the organization be r
esponsive to the prescribed accountability measures.
 
The authoritative discourses on Catholicity that form Catholic educators 
such as 
Maxine and Roger predominantly derive from changes to Catholicism that 
originated in the 1960s as a result of the 
Second V
atican Council (Vatican
 
II). 
Groome (1998), in 
Educating for 
Life
, drew o
n Vatican
 
II documents to 
emphasize to Catholic educators 
the 
shift from a more conservative and 
institutional 

expression

 
of Catholicism 
to an understanding of small
-
c 

catholic
 
Chr
istian

 
(p.
 
413). 
The word catholic means 

universal
,

 
and Catholic teachings, 
139
 
 
according to Groome, are characterized by inclusiveness and openness to learn
ing
 
from other traditions, as well as 

abiding love for all people with commitment to 
their welfare,
 
rights, and justice

 
(p.
 
413). Discourses on Catholicity explicitly 
name Gospel values and Catholic principles as appropriate school attitudes and 
behaviours and engender qualities such as honesty, generosity, compassion, 
justice, and conciliation.
 
As a b
eginning AP in TCSD, Roger struggled with his understandings of 
his new role as an administrator in relation to Catholic education and its impact 
(or lack thereof) on administrative decisions. Roger believe
s
 
that teacher
s

 
support 
for the discipline he met
ed out to students depended upon his relationship with the 
adults in the school and their perception
s
 
of him as a leader. In certain contexts he 
garnered support for his disciplinary 
actions; however, Roger believes
 
that 
on 
other occasions 
staff measured h
is decisions based upon his enactment of 

Catholic principles, values, [and] protocols of the school.

 
He hoped that 
the 
teachers did not consider him 

excessive

 
or harsh in the way that he disciplined 
students or dealt with staff. Roger

s identity as a 
C
atholic 
AP
 
was strongly 
associated with the Catholic values he employed to measure behav
iour, his own
 
as 
well as the behaviours of other members on staff. This strong association 
with
 
Catholic values seemed to trouble Roger the most as he recounted instanc
es of 
conflict in which people

s actions did not follow an expected pattern of 
conciliation.
 
Conciliation 
wa
s a particularly persuasive discourse of Catholic education 
for Roger. As an AP, he felt the tension of trying to live out Catholic values in 
140
 
 
attemp
ting to resolve contentious issues. For him, this now became much more 
complex than simply speaking for himself as a teacher. For example, at a staff 
meeting, when administrative decisions could 

not make everybody happy

 
even 
after 
the staff

s ideas were 
taken 
into account, arriving at a consensus was 
difficult. 
He
 
felt uncomfortable about the seeming absence of Catholic values
,
 
and 
his use of the phrase 

collateral damage

 
points to the extent of unintentional 
emotional injury 
to 
both the teacher group an
d the two administrators. No longer 
able to associate himself with the former group, Roger 
is now 
talking through his 
transition from teacher to his new and difficult role as an administrative leader. He 
is struggling with his identity as an AP, with his d
esire to be what he perceives is a 
good Catholic (being fair and respectful, which was seemingly easier as a teacher) 
and having to make tough decisions or to take tough stances relating to 
pedagogical and behavioural issues. Throughout these first months 
in the role, 
Roger 
has been 
rethinking what it means to be a Catholic educator. Conceivably, 
the occasion of our conversations that were part of the participant interviews may 
also be a contributing factor to 
the 
shift in Roger

s understanding of the impac
t of 
having become 
an 
AP
.
 
Com
pliance and Autonomous Decision Making
 
Becoming a new 
AP
 
demands 
both 
the AP

s compliance with existing 
authoritative discourses of leadership responsibilities, district policies, and 
practices
 
and
 
the expectation that educatio
nal leaders will exercise autonomous 
power a
nd authority. The new APs in this
 
study held general conceptions of what 
it is to be a good and valuable educational administrator
,
 
and they 
assumed 
the 
141
 
 
role prepared to act. Their encounter with the school commu
nity

s expectations, 
which are representative of the circulating authoritative discourses, prompted a 
response in the process of developing their identities as leaders; they could accept 
the status quo, resist it, or negotiate a new understanding of what i
t means to lead.
 
Educational 
leader
s

 
compliance is intricately tied with the various 
authoritative discourses of leadership that structure school districts and are 
manifest in mandates from the province

s Ministry of Education. As 
I 
mentioned 
in 
c
hapters 
four
 
and 
five
, the two Catholic school districts in the study 
are 
account
able
 
to the 
ministry yearly for 
multiple measures that 
they report
 
in 
three
-
year education plans and annual reports. 
The 
school p
rincipals in these districts 
have
 
to provide
 
pieces of
 
these 
data to their superintendent
s
 
(i.e.
,
 
goals of the 
school aligned with the goals of the school district and province, parent/
teacher/
student surveys, school growth plans, budget information, and assessment of 
outcomes from programs of study) as the
y oversee the daily operation of their 
schools. School principals and 
AP
s must also support the initiatives that their 
districts believe will 
continually improve
 
these measures. The district
-
level focus 
for professional development in both MCSD and TCSD 
is
 
on the role of the 
principal
; for
 
the former
, on
 
establishing clear links with the Gallup 
Organization 
to build more effective schools
;
 
and
 
for
 
the latter
, on
 
developing Catholic 
educational leaders.
 
New APs Brian, Roger, and Maxine expressed appreciation
 
for the support 
from 
their respective districts as they were introduced to the desirable leadership 
practices 
that 
each district 
considered important
. They mentioned leadership 
142
 
 
meetings, access to professional resources, and principal mentorship as 
means 
of 
becoming part of the overall fabric of educational administration. However, as our 
conversations progressed, they began to measure their needs and experiences 
against what their respective districts were promising. Brian wondered 
about 
the 
actual correl
ation between the Gallup measures and how teachers were being 
ranked for interviews, as well as how being matched with a principal, based on an 
assessment of their individual strengths, might mitigate the uncertainty he felt in 
the role. Roger and Maxine i
dentified mentorship 
from 
their principals and the 
general nature of the topics at professional development sessions as obstacles to 
their ability to fully develop
 
into the 

good

 
Catholic leaders to 
which they 
aspired.
 
But this level of compliance 
with 
th
eir district

s conceptualization of 
leadership was not the most pressing to the three first
-
year leaders. More 
immediate were the challenges and conflicts that arose as a result of the 
expectations of the school community within their first months as they 
interacted 
with staff and students. In their new roles as APs, Brian, Roger, and Maxine were 
expected to fit into the existing structures of their respective schools, but they also 
anticipated exercising some measure of autonomous power and authority as 
ed
ucational leaders as they began to develop their AP identities.
 
In his first months as an 
AP
 
with MCSD, Brian encountered dilemmas 
between the preexisting traditions associated with past 
AP
s in the school
 
and
 
his 
desire to develop his own style and his asp
iration to make a difference in his 
school community. This struggle became more evident when 
the staff met 
his 
143
 
 
understanding of the AP role with some resistance. 
Some teachers who were 
friendly with Brian when he arrived 
at 
the school solicited his support
 
for 
the 
school

s 
existing structures, programs, and rules. However, 
he 
began to exert a 
measure of control over certain student discipline practices, which he described as 
not very student
 
centered
,
 
and to advocate for contrary students to stay in class a
ll 
day
 
rather than 
being removed by teachers for what he considered minor 
misdemeano
u
rs. In the process of 
persuading 
teachers to consider an alternative 
approach to this type of classroom discipline, Brian found that challenging 
the 
current values and pra
ctices involved a significant degree of persuasion and 
negotiation in response to their resistance. Some teachers found him too lenient
,
 
and he 
considered 
them too harsh. He recognized a need to proceed with more 
sensitivity and collaboration to effect a c
hange that he perceived as necessary. In 
his attempt to establish his own meaning of authority 
in 
the role of AP that 
resisted the norms of the school, his internally persuasive voice admitted 

a 
variety of contradictory social discourses

 
(Britzman, 2003
,
 
p.
 
42). These social 
discourses reflected the tension between what the community expected and the 
type of power and authority 
that 
Brian though
t
 
appropriate 
but 
that did not 
adhere 
to 
current practices in the school.
 
As an educational leader, Roger seemed
 
to be more comfortable meeting 
the requirements of existing authoritative discourses of leadership responsibilities, 
but struggled with positive ways to exercise autonomous power and authority. The 
expectations 
that 
Roger

s principal
 
had laid out

for exam
ple, in assigning him 
tasks that he did not want to do

underpin the assumption that Roger would fit 
144
 
 
into a specific role and that, in due time, he would gain a level of competency 
with 
those defined tasks. Roger seemed to take on these assigned tasks with 
a 
degree of ease, and although he struggled to understand the nuances of this role, 
he believed that his technical skills would improve over time. He resisted, 
however, other aspects of the role, one of which was the expectation 
of 
teachers 
and students 
th
at he would 
sort out their problems.
 
For Roger, having the identity of an educational leader did not include 
covering 
teachers

 
classroom
s
 
because of their personal problems or their 
difficulties in managing their classroom discipline, nor did he anticipat
e the need 
to frequently help students deal with friendship
-
related issues. His admission that 
he was 

forced to drop his administrative work

 
during those times illustrates the 
extent to which he perceived 
his 
various tasks as an AP as inappropriate or 
un
befitting the role. Roger

s negotiation of 
the leadership practices that did
 
not 
match his own understanding of what constitutes good leadership practice 
wa
s 
complicated by many factors, including his own deep investments and the role 
expectations o
f those
 
in the school. As an AP
 
he 
had to 
decide 
whether 
it 
wa
s 
easier to remain part of the existing rest
rictions, rules, and traditions
 
and conform 
to the 

mandates of inherited contexts

 
(Britzman, 2003
, p.
 
40) or to be critical of 
the internal structures.
 
Rog
er was inclined to 
privately 
express his concerns (i.e.
,
 
to me as the interviewer) 
with 
the school

s existing internal structures such as 
the 
frequent covering of teachers

 
class
es at their request and the draining task of 
arbitrating between squabbling st
udents, 
but
,
 
outwardly, he performed what was 
asked of him. This negotiation between his personally persuasive discourses that 
145
 
 
allowed him to consent
 
to being cooperative and conciliatory within the school 
environment and the authoritative discourses that 
operated to shape leaders 
underscores the kind of tension 
that 
a new AP might typically encounter.
 
In this chapter I discussed how Brian, Roger, and Maxine, three new 
AP
s 
in two Catholic school districts, negotiated personally persuasive discourses and 
aut
horitative discourses of leadership to shape their identities as educational 
leaders. 
I examined t
he 
AP
s

 
negotiation of conflicting understandings of 
leadership first
 
and
 
then analyzed how 
they negotiated 
their deeply held values 
with 
the 
traditional inst
itutional demands of administration. Finally, I discussed 
their compliance with existing authoritative discourses of leadership policies and 
practices alongside the expectation that these first
-
year APs 
would 
also exercise 
autonomous power and authority. T
he negotiation process in the ideological 
becoming of an AP
 
is demonstrated 
as 
ongoing, dynamic, and typically private.
 
In chapter seven I present my conclusions based on the analysis in chapter 
six and suggest 
the 
implications of the study.

CHAPTER SEVEN
:
 
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS OF THE STUDY
 
Brian, Roger, and Maxine are first
-
year 
AP
s
 
in two Catholic school 
districts who, like other APs new to the role, negotiated personally persuasive and 
authoritative discourses to fashion identities as educational
 
leaders. 
In c
hapter six 
I 
analyzed 
the 
ways in which these participants consented to or resisted three 
particular authoritative discourses during their first months as 
AP
s that included 
encounters with contradictory understandings of leadership, challenge
s to deeply 
held values, and struggles between their compliance with existing authoritative 
discourses of leadership and the expectation that new APs 
will 
act with autonomy. 
In this chapter I present my conclusions about the conflicting discourses 
that 
cir
culate
 
within the two districts and their schools. I underscore the importance of 
acknowledging that novice educational leaders, like teachers, negotiate their 
identities and do not simply fit into existing role
s
. Finally, I discuss the 
implications of the
 
study for school districts and for new 
AP
s.
 
Conflicting Autho
ritative Discourses 
That Circulate
 
Within 
Districts and 
Their 
Schools
 
Identifying the specific authoritative discourses that shape the leadership 
practices of new 
AP
s is a task that practitioner
s in the field rarely contemplate. 
However, Britzman

s (2003) assertion that authoritative discourses 
indeed operate
 
to shape teacher
s

 
identities prompted my shift from thinking about leadership 
first as simply a concept to learn about
,
 
and second as a fi
nite number of 
leadership skills to be acquired to be effective in the role of educational 
147
 
 
administrator. I began
 
to look more critically at th
e authoritative discourses that 
shape how leader
s understand
 
their work and influence what 
they do
. Although 
auth
oritative discourses do not noticeably play a role in what we learn about 
leadership within our school district, they 

enter our verbal consciousness as a 
compact and indivisible mass

 
(Bakhtin, 1981
, p.
 
343) to shape the very fabric of 
our thoughts and ac
tions and form our identities as educational administrators. 
The authoritative discourses of leadership that I discuss in the study became 
apparent 
in my 
analysis of 
the participants

 
language and actions 
in 
their 
interviews, the documents from t
heir respe
ctive school district
s, the texts from the 
province

s Ministry of Education, 
and the 
literature on educational leadership. 
The three particular authoritative discourses of leadership that 
I emphasize in the 
study

the discourses of Catholic education, 
the 
d
iscursive practices of 
autonomous and
 
relational leadership, and neoliberal discourses

are, of course, 
not the only authorit
ative discourses that influence
 
the identity formation of 
educational leaders in the two Catholic school districts. Some of the othe
r 
authoritative discourses that drew my attention, but that 
I did not further pursue
 
because they did not seem to emerge as prominentl
y in the research data, include
 
those 
that shape gender differences in leadership and discourses of the born 
leader. These
 
and other authoritative discourses form a part of the greater whole 
of 
the 
discourses in our culture 
that 
shape particular worldviews and dispositions 
that dominate our thinking.
 
Any 
given social context
 
involves
 
many and varied types of authoritative 
dis
courses, some of which may be at variance with 
the 
other
s
. Bakhtin (1981) 
148
 
 
pointed out that authoritative discourses may organize around themselves great 
masses of other types of discourses
,
 
but they do not merge. They remain 

sharply 
demarcated

 
(p.
 
343) a
nd subsequently set conditions for discursive practices that 
may be inconsistent with each other and perhaps even contradictory.
 
Hierarchical 
Versus Collegial Models 
of 
Leadership in Schools and Districts
 
The authoritative discourses of autonomous and rela
tional leadership, 
which 
are
,
 
respectively
,
 
hierarchical and collegial, exist in a spectrum of 
perspectives that are dichotomous at either end in terms of how power is enacted. 
These discourses form part of the conflicting expectations of the 
role of 
leade
r 
in 
TCSD that operate to shape the work lives and the identities of two of 
its 
new 
leaders. In a discretionary process that is not consistent across schools, TCSD

s
 
principals are authorized to act with autonomy but 
are 
also expected to share 
leadership d
ecisions with 
their school communities
, as 
the 
current literature on 
educational administration 
recommended 
(
Hatcher, 2005; 
Lambert, 1998
,
 
2002, 
2003; Murphy, 2005
; Wasley, 1992
). A neophyte might be confused by this range 
of leadership behaviours that 
the
 
district itself does 
not easily clarif
y
. Roger 
articulated his uncertainty about 
the ways in which leadership is 
enacted in his 
school 
with regard to
 
decisions

for example
,
 
at a staff meeting between his 
principal and 
the 
teachers

but he also emphasized
 
h
is own 
efforts
 
to personally 
identify
 
what he felt was most appropriate in building and maintaining a 
professional relationship with 
the 
staff members. In a situation that is largely 
ambiguous and alienating, new AP
s
 
are 
likely to struggle with 
their 
under
standing 
of what constitutes a 

good

 
leader 
as their own identities
 
as leader
s are
 
formed. 
149
 
 
Such a struggle is more likely to leave 
them 
with a weakened stance as 
they 
negotiate
 
the expectations of the role. The tension inherent in other authoritative 
disc
ourses, such as those shaped by neoliberalism and Catholicity
,
 
also impact 
how identities are negotiated.
 
Neoliberal 
Versus 
Catholic 
Models 
of 
Leadership 
in 
Schools 
and 
Districts
 
In both TCSD and MCSD, neo
liberal policies shape 
the 
authoritative 
discourses
 
of leadership that potentially compromise the values espoused in 
models of Catholic educational leaders
hip, such as caringness, value for
 
all 
children equally, and social transformation (Gewirtz & Ball, 2000). Government 
policies, influenced by neoliberal
ism, reduce and tighten education budgets and 
demand performance measures from school districts that then make it increasingly 
difficult to maintain 
purposes
 
of education that are not largely economic (Gewirtz 
& Ball, 2000; Levin, 2001; Wallace, 2004). TCS
D 
has 
acknowl
edged
 
the tension 
between these discourses by focusing a portion of 
its 
professional development 
for leaders on personal integrity and ethical decision
 
making to counter leadership 
that emphasizes managerial and market accountability. A beginn
ing leader 
such 
as 
Maxine, who 
has accepted a social
-
justice mandate to serve an impoverished 
community well and equally attempts to effectively fulfill the operational 
demands of the role, does so at a cost to the self. To some extent she 
has ignored
 
the 
discrepancies between discourses and consents to both to fashion her identity 
as a 

good

 
leader, but the time 
that 
it takes to fulfill these competing models of 
leadership is literally exhausting and increasingly impossible.
 
150
 
 
MCSD

s approach to these dispa
rate authoritative discourses 
was to 
attempt to integrate neo
liberal practices 
and 
Catholic understandings of leadership 
to maximize 
its 
limited resources 
to hire and train
 
staff for the district. 
Its 
goal 
was to establish a strong connection between 
the 
p
urposes of Catholic 
education

for example, to identify the staff

s Go
d
-
given talents as part of the
 
Catholic ministry

with the strategies that Gallup offered to improve productivity 
and overall efficiency. Although new AP Brian 
has 
outwardly 
consented
 
to t
his 
approach, his description of its implementation during our interview underscored 
his uncertainty 
about the conflict between 
the theory behind Gallup

s business 
practices and his district

s chosen direction, 
and 
his own understanding of 
leadership pract
ice. For Brian, the negotiation of his AP identity as a leader may 
become more complicated as he better articulates his own values and beliefs. 
Given the fluid nature of identity, he and other APs will continue to construct 
their identities as leaders as t
heir contexts change. The negotiation between 
personally persuasive and authoritative discourses of leadership to fashion AP
s

 
identities largely depends upon the existing leadership practices in the 
environment and the background experiences that AP
s brin
g
 
to the role.
 
Questions of Identity in Leadership Development
 
The role that 
a 
new 
AP
 
take
s
 
on cannot be understood 
only 
in the context 
of its tasks and responsibilities within the org
anizational structure of school;
 
u
nderstanding what it is like to become
 
an 
AP
 
also requires some 
acknowledgement that one

s identity as an AP is simultaneously being 
constructed. 
However, my study shows that a focus on identity formation
 
is 
151
 
 
largely problematic because it involves an internal process that is not easil
y 
discern
i
ble to an outside observer. The internally persuasive discourses of an 
AP
 
affirm, reinforce, negotiate, and resist the authoritative discourses that shape the 
leadership role in an ongoing process that is essentially implicit and 
characteristically privat
e. Furthermore, authoritative discourses themselves 
operate in unseen ways 
and demand
 
that we 

acknowledge [them and] make them 
our own

 
(Bakhtin, 1981
, p.
 
343) as we engage in the cultural and social 
behaviours inherent in our society.
 
 
To further underst
and what it is like to become an 
AP
 
beyond the 
organizational structure of the role, it is important to reflect on why addressing the 
identity formation of new APs was problematic 
in 
the two school communities in 
the study. Questions of AP identity did not
 
seem central to the running of the 
school because new APs were more likely expected to fit within the existing 
expectations of leadership and not 
to 
disrupt the existing flow. 
The 
principal and 
the needs of the school community that pre
date
 
the AP

s arriv
al
 
largely determine 
the role itself
. As Roger observed, his district did not consider his fit with the 
school as a whole but 
was 
more concerned that 
his 
skills would complement 
those 
of 
his principal. His placement puzzled him for several months
.
 
The deve
lopment 
of AP identity might not readily come into question because school districts can 
expect 
that 
the educational leader role 
will 
be filled by an aspiring educator 
who 
is 
able to follow district policies and school rules and is willing to conform more 
or less to the status quo. This statement is not intended to diminish the work of an 
AP, but to provoke discussion 
on 
the extent to which a new AP puts aside aspects 
152
 
 
of the self in order to fit the role. In my own case as an AP new to a school, my 
principa
l informed me 
early on 
that 
the responsibility to be the swim coach 
fell to 
me, as it did to my predecessor. The fact that I do not know how to swim was not 
persuasive enough to change the assignment of this inherited task; it was then 
incumbent upon me to
 
figure out how to solve my problem, which required a 
quantity of energy and some angst that I might not succeed in this endeavour. I 
have been the swim coach now for over a year.
 
 
Although new APs are actively negotiating discourses of leadership as 
they 
take on the challenges 
of 
the role, this negotiation is seldom recognized 
within the school districts. The lack of focus on AP identity in the research and 
the daily work of school should be of concern, however, to educators. In a school, 
identity formatio
n is something that happens to the developing student and is not 
expected of the growing adult. Bracher (2006) argued that teachers should take 
responsibility for 
the 
ways in which their own 

identity needs drive and direct 
their teaching

 
because of their
 
potential to 

threaten the identities of many 
students

 
(p.
 
xiv) rather than support them. Similarly, school leaders should also 
be encouraged to examine and analyze the forms of identity support that they seek 
through their current leadership practices. 
Even before he became an AP, Brian 
was very conscious of his identity being constructed as an instructional leader 
(i.e.
,
 
when he engaged
 
in many individual projects when he completed his 
master

s 
degree). 
He assumed that the teachers in his school would r
ecognize the 
support that he sought
 
as the identity of an AP with particular beliefs about 
teaching and learning. This recognition did not extend to his district

s view of 
153
 
 
him
,
 
as I have previously discussed, and his initial response was to
 
consent; 
howeve
r, he seemed to develop
 
some resistance once he began to articulate his 
understandings. Addressing questions of identity would compel the school 
community 
to invest energy and effort in
 
recognizing the individual interests and 
strengths of 
its 
leaders
 
and
 
to actively maintain and support AP identity.
 
 
By acknowledging, developing, and strengthening identity, an 
organization

s employees improve their 
relatio
nships with each other and make
 
the environment a better place to work 
and 
learn (Bracher, 2006). A gr
eater focus 
on relationship is rooted in an ethic of care for the well
-
being of others (Starratt, 
1991). The difficulties of investing energy in developing relationships with and 
between 
AP
s exist on multi
ple
 
levels. Time especially is a factor 
during 
days
 
that 
are overwhelmed with teaching, considerable tasks, and numerous student 
concerns, as Maxine and her principal found when 
they tried 
to find time to foster 
a mentoring relationship. On a district level, funding for release time for the many 
APs who te
ach during the day can also be an inhibiting factor. Effective 
professional development for neophytes, however, might be as straightforward as 
inviting conversation at the end of the day on topics that 
will ease 
the transition 
into the role. During the int
erview process with 
the 
participants whilst I was 
gathering data for the study, it was apparent to me that some movement in 
understanding the self in relation to the role was beginning to occur. As these 
AP
s 
articulated their understandings of leadership, 
for example, through metaphor or 
by reflecting on examples of good leadership, they began 
to voice 
some of the 
conflicts or contradictions that they had encountered in their schools. The 
154
 
 
researcher
-
participant relationship itself that developed during this
 
research 
seemed to have become a forum for authentic dialogue that centered and placed 
value on the other

s experience. Although it can 
be assumed that school district 
leaders and principals 
sincerely care for those 
who work
 
in the
ir
 
schools, 
they 
should 
be cautioned not 
to 
lose sight of these human factors.
 
Implications of the Study
 
Implications for School Districts
 
The implications of the study largely focus on the need to attend to the 
identity formation of the 
AP
. For school districts
 
this might imply
 
how 
they 
conceptualize 
leadership for the purpose of training new leaders
 
and
 
how 
attending to subjectivity might enable 
a 
greater focus on the leader

s quality of 
life. The way that a school district organizes its professional development for 
prospective 
administrative leaders reflects what it values and envisions for the 
leadership corps of the district. Leadership training programs essentially reinforce 
the authoritative discourses that are played out in the school district
,
 
and 
the 
emphasis lies more 
in
 
the 
preparation for the leadership 
role
 
than 
in 
acknowledgement of the
 
impact on the 
self
. This was the case with both TCSD 
and MCSD
,
 
because 
their 
leadership training 
focuses
 
on the role of the principal 
and the mainstream literature on leadership that 
h
as 
emphasized role and 
effectiveness in the role, at times from a business perspective. To shift thinking 
towards caring for the development of identities within the organization, school 
districts should invite a broader, more critical perspective of leade
rship that 
interrupts and redefines the authoritative discourses 
that shape
 
perceptions of the 
155
 
 
AP
 
role. New APs should 
have 
opportunities to acknowledge and articulate the 
conflicts and contradictions that they encounter 
with regard to
 
their 
understandings
 
and misunderstandings of leadership. Without a safe forum for 
discussion, the negotiation of identities is very difficult for beginning AP
s
 
as 
they 
attempt
 
to figure out their new role, especially in situations 
that demonstrate 
a 
reluctance to speak out o
r critique existing structures when injustices or 
compromising situations are encountered. 
My 
interviews with 
the 
neophyte APs 
were important conversations because they revealed
, and gave the participants an 
opportunity to give voice
 
to
, a growing insight 
into their own agency as leaders.
 
School districts should be convinced of the importance of 
investing energy 
and effort in
 
recognizing the individual interests and strengths of their leaders by 
focusing on relationships
 
that are
 
rooted in an ethic of care 
for the well
-
being of 
others. In a system 
in which 
educational leaders question and/or repress their 
values because the institutional demands of school appear as more pressing and 
immediate, an ethic of care is easily compromised. Mentorship, for example, 
should not be sacrificed because of time constraints; it should be valued for the 
guidance and connectedness that it can 
offer 
new educational leader
s
 
to actively 
maintain and support a healthier quality of life. With this kind of enhancement, 
the negotiat
ion of diverse discourses of leadership would perhaps strengthen 
AP
s

 
identity and reduce the ambiguity of the role.
 
Implications for New Assistant Principals
 
The implications of the study for first
-
year 
AP
s cent
e
r foremost on their 
understanding that the 
role is not the same as their identity as leaders. It is most 
156
 
 
important 
that 
new APs recognize the necessity of 
negotiating
 
the educational 
leader role. 
The 
principal and the needs of the school community that pre
date
 
the 
AP

s arrival and embody the circul
ating authoritative discourses
 
largely determine 
the role of the AP
; a new AP is more likely expected to fit within 
the 
existing 
expectations of leadership and not 
to 
disrupt the existing flow. The identity of the 
AP
, however, is more complex and largely d
etermined by the negotiation of these 
expectations in relation to the needs of the person 
who assumes
 
the role. Thus, his 
or her response to the role is significant in the process of developing an identity as 
a leader.
 
In terms of their own self
-
understand
ing, the 
conceptions of the 
neophyte 
APs in the study of what it is to be a good and valuable educational administrator 
were 
based on their distinctive histories in addition to the influence of 
the 
authoritative discourses of leadership that existed within
 
their school districts. 
Upon 
assuming 
the leadership role, however, they were forced to consent to or 
resist the status q
uo within their school communities
 
as they negotiated 
between 
the
ir
 
personally persuasive discourses and the authoritative discourses 
of 
leadership that have now become more relevant. Beginning APs 
such as Maxine
 
uncritically accepted the way 
that things are in the school and 
district and 
integrated new understandings of what it means to lead, despite the incredible cost 
to her time and 
energy. B
rian initially accepted the pre
existing expectations in his 
school
 
and 
district and suppressed aspects of the self; his growing awareness of 
resistance to the status quo of neoliberal influences became apparent 
in 
discussion
s
 
of wha
t leadership me
ans to him and of
 
the impact of becoming a 
157
 
 
leader 
in 
MCSD. Roger also in
itially consented to his school

s and 
district

s 
expectations, but his resistance intensified as he described the lack of district 
support for the role and the discrepancies in how lea
dership was being played out 
in his school. This kind of resistance can lead to the activation of various 
defence
 
mechanisms. Bracher (2006) emphasized the importance of learning more about 
how a person

s 

identity needs motivate and direct [
his or her
] ac
tions

 
(p.
 
xiii) 
and how an underdeveloped and insecure identity interferes with learning. 
Attending to the identity of the 
AP
 
would enhance the leadership role
, which
 
entails understanding the authoritative discourses of leadership that shape these 
roles.
 
In a large institution 
such as 
a school district, 
it is difficult to 
increase
 
the 
awareness 
that 
AP identities 
are in fact being developed,
 
but this case study has 
attempted to reveal part of that world.
 
In this chapter I emphasized that new 
AP
s unavoidab
ly negotiate their 
identities and do not simply fit into an existing role. To this end, I presented my 
conclusions regarding the conflicting authoritative discourses 
that circulate
 
within 
two Catholic districts and their schools 
to 
shape AP identity. I dis
cussed questions 
of ide
ntity in leadership development;
 
specifically
,
 
what it is like to become an 
AP
 
beyond the organizational structure of the role. I presented 
the 
implications of 
the study for s
chool districts that underscore
 
the need to better attend 
to the 
development of AP identity, with implications for leadership training programs 
and a better quality of life for APs. Finally, I suggest that new APs themselves 
address the differences between role and identity and direct 
their 
attention to the 
impor
tance of developing and strengthening their identities as educational leaders.

SYNOPSIS OF MISSION
 
CATHOLIC SCHOOL DISTRICT
 
(2002), 
ROLE OF THE PRINCIPAL FOR
 
SCHOOL
 
ADMINISTRATOR EVALUATIO
N
 
Mission Catholic School 
District (MCSD) provides all schools with a district 
document entitled 

The Role of the Principal for School Administrator 
Evaluation

 
(Mission Catholic School District, 2002). This document acts as the 
basis for school site administrator evaluation in ord
er to provide consistency, 
focus, and assistance to district personnel to ensure a quality evaluation. In this 
document, the district organizes the role of the principal around cultural, 
instructional, and managerial/organizational leadership perspectives,
 
as well as it 
outlines the desirable personal and professional attributes of an accomplished 
school administrator, and his or her skill with interpersonal relationships.
 
In MCSD, the principal as a strong cultural leader promotes the mission, values, 
beli
efs, and goals of the district, creates a faith
-
based school community, and 
promotes the success of all students and staff within a shared vision of learning. 
An effective instructional leader maximizes student learning, attends to the 
supervision and eval
uation of staff, promotes life
-
long learning for him
-
 
or herself 
and staff, and provides leadership in curriculum delivery based on current 
research regarding effective instruction and evaluation practices. A leader who 
manages and organizes the school suc
cessfully ensures that his or her practices 
maximize efficiency and effectiveness of the scope of the school operation, in 
order to provide for a safe, secure, and caring learning environment.
 
The personal and professional attributes of a school administra
tor that are 
considered most desirable by MCSD are to act in an ethical and moral manner in 
keeping with the Catholic faith, to demonstrate continuous learning and 
participation in ongoing professional development and growth, and to engage in 
effective dec
ision
-
making processes and behaviours. The interpersonal 
relationships that a principal takes on should involve the effective development of 
positive relations with all stakeholders, including other administrators, in an 
appropriate and meaningful way.
 
Eac
h of these descriptors is supported by more specific behaviours that exemplify 
the particular practice.

ARACTERISTICS OF THE SUCCESSFUL
 
SCHOOL ADMINISTRATOR
 
Trinity Catholic School Distric
t
 
(TCSD)

s publication, 

Characteristics of the 
Successful School Administrator

 
(Trinity Catholic School District, 1995) is a 
compilation of characteristics that best exemplify a successful school 
administrator in TCSD. These characteristics were identifi
ed by over 70 staff 
respondents, who provide a sense of what leadership looks like as instructional, 
religious, and managerial in nature, as well as what constitutes the desired 
personal qualities and skills of a school leader.
 
An instructional leader know
s the curriculum and ensures that the programs of 
study are carried out. He or she monitors classroom teaching and provides 
feedback to teachers on their teaching practices, encouraging different teaching 
styles and inclusive practices. This type of leader
 
has student achievement as their 
main concern. Religious leadership is demonstrated through the enactment of 
Catholic values and by providing for religious activities in the school. A religious 
leader has a sincere and deep faith in children and is a stro
ng advocate for 
Catholic education. He or she works effectively with others to secure their 
cooperation and uses effective group process skills. The utilization of a 
democratic
-
participatory style of leadership is also a characteristic of religious 
leaders
hip. A school administrator as an effective manager organizes day
-
to
-
day 
operations and delegates tasks appropriately, as well as manages financial and 
physical resources.
 
The personal qualities of a successful TCSD administrator include being ethical, 
hon
est, adaptable, committed to practicing the Catholic faith, and demonstrating 
integrity. Other qualities are maintaining a positive attitude, having courage, 
possessing high energy and high tolerance to stress. A school leader must also 
have skills in huma
n relations, planning, oral and written communication, 
organization, and problem solving. As well, he or she should articulate a clear and 
informed vision that focuses on students and their needs, and focuses on what the 
school should become.

APPENDIX E:
 
SYNOPSIS OF TRINITY C
ATHOLIC SCHOOL DISTRICT
 
(2007
),
 
PERFORMANCE APPRAISAL OF A SCHOOL
 
ADMINISTRATOR IN TRINITY CATHOLIC SCHOOLS
 
The evaluation form used by the Trinity Catholic School District (TCSD) 
provides a record of an administrator

s performance in 
terms of work quality and 
of his or her understanding of the goals and objectives of the district. In 
completing a performance appraisal, an evaluator must take into consideration the 
nature of the school and the community the school serves, as well as the
 
description of the administrator

s assignment.
 
The competencies that a TCSD administrator must demonstrate are organized into 
four categories: religious/moral/ethical leadership; educational leadership; 
instructional leadership; and managerial leadership.
 
As a religious, moral, and 
ethical leader, an administrator establishes and maintains a climate within the 
school that fosters growth as a Catholic educational community. Such a leader 
acts with moral and ethical integrity by demonstrating courage and exe
rcising 
good judgment. As an educational leader, he or she collaborates with the school 
community to create and to sustain a vision for continuous school improvement. 
This is enacted by leading a professional learning community and by encouraging 
and empha
sizing team work and staff participation. To demonstrate instructional 
leadership, an administrator applies systemic procedures for improving the skills 
and practices of personnel in order to ensure that all students have access to 
quality teaching and opp
ortunities for success. Some of the competencies of an 
effective instructional leader include supervising teachers to ensure that the 
outcomes of the prescribed programs of study are being taught and monitoring the 
effective use of class time. A managerial
 
leader successfully manages school 
operations and resources to sustain a safe and caring Cat
holic learning 
environment. Administrators must demonstrate competence in developing a 
budget document that reflects the goals and objectives of the school and ensure 
that fiscal priorities are implemented with input from staff.

based administrator position. I cannot say whether t
his 
particular philosophical statement was typical of other applicants, but it was how I 
interpreted the request.
 
A Catholic school must be committed to the development of the whole person, 
and committed to the cultivation of human values that serve all pe
ople. Such a 
learning environment reflects the identity and character of the Catholic church. 
The expression of the uniqueness of the Catholic experience is embodied in a 
school

s community, through its constant welcome, humanness, and encounters 
with God,
 
its many faith traditions with a growing collective wisdom, its 
awareness of and actions for social justice, and its rootedness in the Holy Trinity.
 
In my day

to
-
day educational practices, my pedagogical approach reflects an 
ongoing dialogue primarily wit
h students and colleagues, but also with others 
whose lives intersect with that of the school (e.g. parents, other school staff, 
district staff). I believe that it is important to ensure that individual stories are told 
and remembered, to continually resto
re and maintain balance, and to lessen the 
distractions and hurriedness of everyday life, in order to nurture the sustained 
attention essential to listening and learning. Finally, it is in pausing every so often 
to ask or thank God for blessings that we ar
e reminded of our frailties and renew 
our aspiration to live the life that God intended.
