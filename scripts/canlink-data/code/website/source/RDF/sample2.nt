    ns7:abstract """This dissertation addressed two main hypotheses:
1.^IBDNF acts through different receptors and/or transduction mechanisms to increase release of excitatory transmitter onto excitatory neurons (using the Trk B signaling pathways) and to decrease release of excitatory transmitter onto inhibitory neurons (via the p75 signaling pathway).
2.^IThe release of CSF-1 by primary afferents after nerve injury leading to the generation of neuropathic pain involves an excitatory action on the dorsal horn mediated via the release of BDNF.
Using an organotypic slice preparation of mice spinal cord slices, seven electrophysiological cell types were identified in the substantia gelatinosa of GAD67-EGFP Tamaguchi CL-1 white albino Swiss mice using whole-cell recording. Of the seven cell types, delay tonic and delay irregular, which are excitatory in nature almost never expressed GAD67 (GAD67-EGFP-) and are largely glutamatergic. 
Long term chronic studies using defined medium organotypic cultures (DMOTC) of mice spinal cords was established and it was determined that all the seven neuronal phenotypes found in acute slices were preserved in culture. The stability of the overall neuronal population decreased but stabilized over the entire duration in culture and slices were intact and healthy during the period of growth. These observations suggested the suitability of using defined medium organotypic cultures of mice spinal cord as long-term disease state models.

    ns1:abstract """This work is devoted to the modelling of heat storage device and energy storage reactors based on fixed-bed geometry. \r
The interparticle discrete-element-method model is developed and used in this work. \r
The model accounts for the interparticle heat exchange directly, which is most useful in a fixed bed where heat transfer between particles is significant.\r
The DEM model can be coupled with one-dimensional or two-dimensional fluid flow and reaction or phase change intraparticle models. \r
The model is used to prove two energy storage solution concepts numerically. The first concept is a new type of fixed-bed reactor for steam-methane reforming (SMR).The reactor consists of two sorts of spherical particles: electrically conductive particles and non-conductive catalyst particles. The main feature of this reactor is the application of electric resistance heating using the electrically conductive particles which heat the non-conductive catalyst particles and reacting gas inside the reactor. Steady-state particle temperatures are calculated based on the developed hybrid model with 3D discrete solid heat transfer and 1D fluid heat and momentum transfer. The modes of heat transfers include conduction between particles, forced convection and radiation. \r
The catalyst size is selected to be 0.4 of radii of the conductive particles, based on the maximum radius at octahedral sites of closed packing.\r
Analysis of simulations based on the electrical current and 3D temperature distribution revealed the optimal volume fraction of catalysts is determined to be between 0.27 and 0.30.\r
The second concept is a heat storage device using encapsulated phase change material (PCM). The PCM considered in this work is paraffin with a melting temperature of 28 \\degree C, which stores heat in the capsules as the PCM melts in a hot environment, and releases when the ambient temperature is cooled down. An intraparticle submodel for the heat rate is described in this work during melting and solidification. The equation for the heat transfer coefficient at the solid-liquid interface is found using direct numerical simulation and validated against published experimental data. A new method of increasing heat transfer is proposed that aluminum particles are mixed in with PCM capsules. The aluminum particles reduce overall charging/discharging time of the heat storage device and make the system more responsive. Numerical simulations using the hybrid model shows that the increase in heat transfer is achieved at the expense of volume efficiency. To reduce the charging/discharging time by 10%, the heat capacity per volume is reduced by 20%.  \r

    ns6:abstract "A non-invasive label-free cytometry technique has been developed and advanced. This laser light scattering technique, alternative to the conventional fluorescent-activated flow cytometry (FACS) using biomarkers, identifies a micro scale particle or biological cell based on its two-dimensional scattered laser light patterns. Patterns have been obtained in three directions: forward, side and backward, and two different wavelengths (green and red) illumination. In this thesis, the label-free cytometry technique was first used to study different sizes of spherical and non-spherical beads, and then non-treated and staurosporine-treated SH-SY5Y cells. The experimental results from the spherical beads were compared to Mie theory. To analyze the patterns from the cells, pattern classification and recognition based on angle distribution method and finding local maximum method have been applied. Preliminary experiment with a capillary tube as well as particles scattering in a droplet which could help the design of practical cytometers have been carried out." ;

    ns6:subject "Chalcogenides, structure, quaternary" ;
    ns5:abstract "New ternary and quaternary chalcogenides were synthesized by reactions of elements or binary starting materials at high temperatures, with an emphasis on identifying structures that are noncentrosymmetric which may lead to useful properties such as nonlinear optical behaviour, magnetic ordering, or ionic conductivity.  Within the quaternary REM-bM-^@M-^SMM-bM-^@M-^SMM-bM-^@M-2M-bM-^@M-^SCh systems (RE = rare-earth elements; M, MM-bM-^@M-2 = d-block metals and p-block metalloids; Ch = S, Se), about 30 new compounds were discovered.  Most of them belong to a versatile family of noncentrosymmetric hexagonal chalcogenides RE3M1M-bM-^@M-^SxMM-bM-^@M-2Ch7, for which the limits of formation were tested.  They include RE3CuGaCh7 and La3Ag0.6GaCh7, which violate the condition of charge balance normally seen in this family; La3MGaSe7 (M = Zn, Cd), which illustrate that M atoms can occupy more than one site; RE3M0.5GeS7 (M = Co, Ni, Pd), which extend the number of examples of nonstoichiometric derivatives of this family; and La3Sn0.5InCh7, which present an exception to the rule that higher-valent substituents prefer the tetrahedral site.  Attempts were made to understand the site preferences of different M and MM-bM-^@M-2 atoms through bond valence sum and band structure calculations.  Other quaternary phases identified in this system are RE4InSbSe9, which is isostructural to a previously known sulfide NLO material, and RE7MInS13 (M = Co, Fe), which adopts a new structure type.  Ternary and quaternary Ba-containing chalcogenides were also investigated.  They include Ba4Ga2Se8 and Ba12In4Se20 exhibiting diselenide units Se22M-bM-^@M-^S, which are less commonly found than disulfide units S22M-bM-^@M-^S.  The quaternary chalcogenide BaRE2In2Ch7 exhibits five-coordinate In in trigonal bipyramidal geometry.  Several quaternary chalcogenides in the BaM-bM-^@M-^SMM-bM-^@M-^SMM-bM-^@M-2M-bM-^@M-^SCh system were found that exhibit noncentrosymmetric structures built up of M- and MM-bM-^@M-2-centred tetrahedra:  Ba4Ga4GeSe12, BaZnMM-bM-^@M-2Se4 (MM-bM-^@M-2 = Si, Ge), and Ba5CdGa6Se15.  Measurement of optical properties showed that BaZnMM-bM-^@M-2Se4 and Ba5CdGa6Se15 are promising candidates for NLO materials with second harmonic generation responses comparable to those of benchmark materials." ;

    ns2:subject "PCI, Coronary artery disease, mortality causes" ;
    ns6:abstract """Objectives: This study evaluated trends in 30-day, 1-, and 2-year cause-specific mortality using a large, contemporary cohort undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
Background: Prior work has shown that patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) are older with higher comorbidities in the past decade, yet population-based data examining the impact of these demographic shifts on cause-specific mortality after PCI remain scant.
Methods: We used the APPROACH registry (Alberta Provincial Project for Outcome assessment in Coronary Heart disease) which captures demographic, clinical, and angiographic data on all the patients undergoing coronary angiogram in Alberta, Canada to identify consecutive patients > 20 years undergoing PCI from the year 2005 to 2013. The cause of death was provided by the Bureau of Vital Statistics and was classified as cardiac or non-cardiac.
Results: Of the 35,602 patients who underwent PCI, 5284 (14.8%) died over a median follow-up of 66 months. In more recent years, patients were older, had more cardiovascular comorbidities, and more PCIs were done for acute coronary syndrome. The 30-day, 1-and 2-year adjusted total mortality after PCI increased significantly over the 9 years (p<0.001). Overall, the most common cause of death was cardiac but non-cardiac deaths increased 28% as time from PCI increased (proportion of non-cardiac deaths: 30-day=11.5%, 1-year=31.5%, 2-year=39.6%; p for trend=<0.001). By 3 years post-PCI, the most common cause of death was non-cardiac for all indications other than ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI); where cardiac remained the predominant cause of death to 6 years.
iii
Conclusion: In this real-world registry, as clinical profiles of patients undergoing PCI worsen, total mortality is increasing. The primary contributor to short-term mortality is cardiac but by 3 years post-PCI non-cardiac mortality predominates except in STEMI patients.""" ;

    ns8:abstract """The purpose of this thesis was to expand the evaluation of community-wide health promotion interventions aimed at individuals by first reviewing previous evaluation research of the effectiveness of community-wide interventions and then incorporating new approaches in implementation and outcome evaluation. To achieve this goal, the first study of the thesis was a systematic review of recent evaluation research that illustrated the effectiveness of community-wide media physical activity campaigns. Twenty-three articles (18 campaigns) were included from the initial 1,692 articles found in 13 databases. The review found that the evaluation of community-wide media physical activity campaigns varied in their respective scope, duration and target population. The effectiveness of the campaigns was determined by individual changes either in proximal, intermediate, or distal level outcomes. The review data supported previous research that the effect size of the campaign decreased when the level of the outcomes moved from proximal to distal. The role of automatic and implicit cognitions in campaign evaluation research has yet to be identified; rather, most research has incorporated explicit and controlled cognitions that are measured using self-report questionnaires. The outcomes of the first study provide guidance for health promoters to implement successful interventions and best practice.
The second study of this thesis tested the effects of a community-wide physical activity campaign (UWALK) by examining the relationships among proximal, intermediate, and distal outcomes as outlined in the hierarchy of effects model. Furthermore, the study incorporated the measure of automatic processes (attentional bias and implicit attitudes) in addition to controlled processes (self-reported awareness and explicit attitudes). Participants (N = 127) reported unprompted awareness and then completed online implicit tasks. Next, they rated prompted awareness of UWALK before watching a UWALK video, and finished questionnaires measuring instrumental and affective attitudes, and leisure time physical activity. Results showed that participants with unprompted awareness of UWALK demonstrated attentional bias toward UWALK images, positive implicit attitudes, and greater leisure-time physical activity compared to unaware counterparts. Attentional bias, awareness, and implicit attitudes significantly predicted behavior, accounting for 15.2% of the variance. However, explicit attitudes were neither related to awareness nor to physical activity. This study demonstrated the importance and feasibility of measuring automatic cognitions in campaign evaluation and provides additional information independent of self-reported controlled cognitions.
The third study was to assess a collaborative partnership between a public and private organization when implementing a smoking cessation program (Run to Quit) based on participantsM-bM-^@M-^Y perspectives. A qualitative description method and inductive analysis process guided the study in order to comprehensively summarize participantsM-bM-^@M-^Y experiences of the Run to Quit program. A total of 14 informants participated in a semi structured phone interview two months after the program ceased. The results provided potential benefits of public-private partnerships collaborating in the program delivery as well as the challenges in managing the program when multiple organizations are engaged. It is further proposed that who a public organization partners with will possibly affect how individuals evaluate information of the intervention; examining automatic cognitions such as attentional bias and implicit attitudes triggered by partner names or logos in the intervention advertisements is proposed to be included in the campaign evaluation framework.
Behavior change interventions are fundamental to the effective practice of public health. The evaluation of interventions that have been conducted in real world settings serves guidance for health promoters when they establish an evidence-based intervention. PPPs in implementation of community-wide health promotion interventions continue to engage the attention of public sector in search of strategies to mobilize resources beyond those available to public sector entities alone, and offering solutions to complex problems. Examining the consequences of PPPs on the implementation and outcome of the intervention provide evidence whether the partnership has actually resulted in positive impacts on participants.""" ;

    ns2:abstract """Knowledge bases (KBs), repositories consisting of entities, facts about entities, and relations between entities, are a vital component for many tasks in artificial intelligence and natural language processing such as semantic search and question answering. Named Entity Disambiguation (NED), the task of disambiguating mentions of named entities in a textual document by linking them to the actual entities in a KB, enables expanding or correcting the KB with facts extracted from documents M-bM-^@M-^S a task called Knowledge Base Population. This thesis focuses on the NED task with the goal of building an accurate, robust, and scalable NED system.

We first propose a graph-based approach that collectively disambiguates mentions of entities in a given document, with the assumption that entities mentioned in a document are semantically related under a single topic. Our approach uses a
carefully-curated disambiguation graph built from a KB, and applies personalized random walks on the graph to compute semantic representations of entities, which are used to measure semantic relatedness and disambiguate named entities.

We then improve the robustness of our NED approach with a supervised learning to rank algorithm using publicly available datasets. We find that the public benchmarks, mainly from news articles, are biased towards well-known entities and not representative to evaluate the robustness of an NED approach. Thus we develop a framework for deriving new benchmarks and construct two benchmarks with varying disambiguation difficulties from two large corpora (Wikipedia and ClueWeb) for the evaluation of robustness.

Finally, to address the scalability issue of our NED approach, we explore various features from entity graphs, contextual texts, and document corpora that can be efficiently pre-computed offline. Instead of performing random walks on online constructed graphs, we use a set of selected landmark nodes from entity graphs to compute the semantic representations of entities. We also explore features derived from the describing documents and associated categories of entities. By precomputing all these features offline, our approach can reduce the computing and memory resources to improve the efficiency and scale out the NED system. The evaluation shows that our approach is very competitive and efficient compared to previous NED approaches.""" ;

    ns2:abstract "The objective of this work is to design a scheme to control the power flow of a hybrid renewable energy system with multiple renewable energy sources with the focus on solar energy and wind energy and multiple energy storage systems. The use of energy storage is necessary due to the intermittency of the renewable energy sources and the consequent peak power shift between the sources and the load. In addition, the use of the energy storage can increase the overall system reliability and stability. In this work, batteries are used as the primary energy storage system for short to medium storage term, while hydrogen fuel cell is used as the long-term energy storage. A supervisory control system is designed to handle various changes in power supply and power demand by managing power intermittency, power peak shaving, and long-term energy storage. Since both power supply and demand are not fully predictable and they have time-variant nonlinear behavior, computational intelligence is introduced to solve this issue and provide suitable control algorithm. This type of control, based on fuzzy logic, combines knowledge of the system and control. The proposed methodology can be optimized such that the system is able to adapt to its working environment and deliver best results under given circumstances. For more realistic simulation results, the designed model utilizes real solar and wind power data and house demand data which were collected by smart meters installed in a project done on houses in Alberta, Canada for the year 2016. The model of the system is designed and simulated in MATLAB SimPowerSystemsM-bM-^DM-" environment to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme." ;

    ns3:abstract """Species diversity patterns and the processes that drive them are a central focus of modern ecology. Although the spatial effects of habitat variation and disturbance on aggregate metrics like diversity and abundance have received considerable attention at local scales, ecologists have virtually ignored the joint influences of habitat variability and disturbance on the temporal variability in communities. Many such studies have dealt with carabid beetles (ground beetles), which are widely used as bioindicators to evaluate faunal response to disturbance. In this dissertation, I have studied variation of boreal ground beetle assemblages in time, in relation to the joint influences of forest cover type and disturbance as a contribution to interpreting the findings of the EMEND (Ecosystem Management Emulating Natural Disturbance) experiment in NW Alberta, Canada.
In chapter 1, I focused on M-NM-1-diversity and studied how local assemblages respond to combinations of retention harvest prescription across four cover types of mixedwood forest, using a 15-year dataset. The work led to three main conclusions: (1) retention harvests better maintain ground beetle diversity than do traditional clear-cuts; (2) beetle assemblages start recovering toward pre-harvest condition immediately after harvest, instead of diverging from it; and (3) beetle assemblages in high retention treatments recover more quickly than do those in low retention treatments. 
Chapter 2 identifies the species that are mostly significantly affected by harvest responsible for large post-harvest species turnover (i.e., beta-diversity) among harvested stands and between them and un-harvested controls. My analysis establishes that (1) retention harvests are associated with lower species turnover than are traditional clear-cuts; (2) species turnover decreases with increased retention; and (3) species turnover in response to harvest is driven mostly by forest specialists, but that the extent of turnover will vary with cover-type. I found that seven reasonably abundant species contributed most to species turnover and classified them as M-bM-^@M-^Xkey speciesM-bM-^@M-^Y for conservation of these carabids in the context of mixedwood forestry. 
Chapter 3 links post-harvest variation to abundance of particular ground beetle species, and I model the abundance of key species, common species and rare species based on information about composition of vegetation. This chapter provides species-specific understanding of how harvest disturbance drives faunal turnover in these forests. Again, there are three main results: (1) habitat variation influences the patterns of abundance, and hence, distribution of ground beetle species and thus affects the structure of local assemblages in quite predictable ways; (2) such influences vary among ground beetle species because they have different habitat requirements; and (3) species distribution in stands harvested with retention are left more similar to un-harvested controls and recover toward forest characteristic of the early phases of boreal succession than in clear-cuts. 
Overall, my dissertation provides the most extensive analysis of forest ground beetle assemblages ever undertaken in relation to anthropogenic disturbance. My dissertation contributes to a habitat-based understanding of M-NM-1- and beta-diversity for carabid beetles of forest systems, and clearly shows that the conservation-related effects of forestry flow from reductions in beta-diversity. Thus, in the more general view, this work increases ecological understanding about species diversity patterns that contributes to building better approaches for long-term biodiversity conservation in the context of sustainable forest management.""" ;

    ns6:abstract """Fault Detection, Isolation and Remediation of Real Processes",,eng,"Fault Detection, Change Detection, Leak Detection, Control Valve Stiction, Stiction-Compensation","The goal of process control and monitoring system is to operate the process plants safely, reliably and in fault-free mode. Even a small fault in the process operation or in the control logic can reduce the efficiency of the process greatly. Normal process transients and operating condition changes can affect the process monitoring and control system adversely if the system cannot identify and separate these normal condition changes from the faults. Such situations may cause a lot of false alarms or alarm-floods and operators may lose confidence in these systems. Therefore, an innovative data-driven change detection algorithm has been proposed. This novel approach will enable the operators to detect changes from the normal condition. The proposed change detection algorithm is based on the Kantorovich distance concept and it does not depend on the type of statistical distribution of the data. The method was applied successfully to the benchmark Tennessee Eastman process (TEP) to detect both abrupt and ramp type changes.\r
\r
Inherent to both the process and pipeline industries are specific faults. In this study, efficient detection and remedial algorithms have been addressed for two such faults. The first fault addressed in this research is the pipeline leak which can cause serious environmental and societal/public safety issues. Such faults can often lead to huge environmental cleanup fees, penalties plus the operation downtime and product losses and poor media coverage. The existing leak detection methods perform poorly in pinpointing the leak location when leak size is less than 10\\% of the nominal flow-rate. When the leak size is less than 5\\%, the existing methods take 0.5 to 1 hr or more to detect the leak. To alleviate these limitations, a novel data-driven leak detection and localization method have been proposed in this study. Unlike the model-based methods, this method does not require tedious parameter tuning. Industrial evaluation of the proposed method in real-time during regulatory leak tests at Suncor Pipeline has confirmed the efficacy of the method. The proposed method was successful in detecting and localizing leak as large as 7\\% to as small as 1\\%. The leak localization efficiency was comparable with the existing commercial method. The leak detection time was much faster than the existing method. \r
\r
Another fault that is commonly encountered in process industries is a sticky actuator. The control valve is the main actuating element in the control loops for both process and pipeline industries. Control valve stiction is the main cause of sustained limit cycles in most control loops and causes unwanted product variability, off-spec product, loss of energy and raw materials. So, early detection of stiction is a primary concern. A novel data-driven stiction detection scheme is proposed in this thesis based on the Kantorovich distance methodology.\r
\r
Since stiction is a physical problem, to replace or repair the valve needs an unplanned shutdown of the plant. Stiction compensation algorithm can reduce the effect of stiction till the next planned shutdown. A novel stiction compensation algorithm has been proposed in this research where a variable amplitude compensating signal is added to the control signal to move the valve stem from its sticky position. This variable amplitude compensating signal can handle uncertainty in the estimation of the stiction parameter. The proposed compensation scheme was applied successfully to a pilot plant equipped with a real sticky valve including built-in valve positioner. The method was successful for both flow and level control loops. The method can reduce the effect of the limit cycle, track dynamic setpoint changes automatically and reject disturbances with less amount of valve movement than other traditional methods.""" ;

groundbreaking technologies nowadays, revolutionizing the traditional manufacturing
and opening the doors to a new generation of complex freeform
engineered functional part. The AM process shows a high correlation between
material, design, and the manufacturing process. This relationship offers the
possibility to tailor and engineer localized material properties within one part.
Currently a number of AM processes are available to deliver tailored mechanical
properties through multi-material printing. In this work a novel integrated
material-manufacturing-control system to print parts with functional
Ferro-magnetic properties is presented. The proposed AM system, based on
material jetting, photo polymerization, real time control system, and active
magnetic alignment control allows the manipulation of the local orientation of
a specialized photosensitive magnetically responsive resin to fabricate objects
with locally controlled anisotropic particles arrangement. The proposed system
builds upon the standard slicing and path planning algorithms used by
open source 3D printing software and extends it by adding two extra dimensions
related to the orientation of the magnetic particles within the printing
process itself enabling the real-time control of the particles orientation of the
printed parts.

    ns4:abstract "The objective of this thesis is to develop, implement and verify a theoretical framework based on detailed analyses and simulation of truck and shovel cycle times in open pit mining, placing an emphasis on the hauling component of the cycle. The goal is to improve the generation of accurate and reliable cycle time estimates to aid in the production planning stages and ongoing performance evaluation. The literature review showed that there is a void in this area of research. In order to achieve this, analyses on a major oil sands operation in Northern Alberta were performed, identifying the source of variability within the cycle time as the truck hauling component. The shortcomings of current commercially available estimating tools are mostly attributed to their overly simplistic assumptions in using truck manufacturersM-bM-^@M-^Y performance data, which indicated operating parameters under ideal conditions that are not indicative of those in practice. In addition, most digital models of mine haul road networks are overly simplistic and lack detail. The main factors affecting the performance of the haul trucks are over or under loading (payload variability), total resistance due to gradients and road conditions, and other hindrances in the haulage such as traffic interactions. This framework introduces two methods for producing cycle time estimates; one that mimics the currently available software packages which solely use manufacturer-supplied data and serves as a benchmark, and another method that is probabilistic and historical data-driven. The main data requirements are outlined, and include a detailed model of the mineM-bM-^@M-^Ys road network, dispatch production records, truck velocity data and other operational parameters such as operating guidelines and rolling resistance values. The concept of EFH is introduced due to a need to categorize different haul routes of equal distances based on how inclined or declined they are, and how rolling resistance varies; which affect truck performance. A computer program was generated using MATLAB, and the algorithm is thoroughly explained. Efforts were made to ensure the flexibility and wide-ranging applicability of this framework to other mining operations. A case study is presented in order to validate the model, and a more advanced application of this new approach is displayed. The data acquisition activities for the mine in the case study are outlined. The framework is validated on four haulage profiles of varying lengths, showing accurate predictions of cycle times. The more advanced application of the framework shown in the case study consists of a productivity and production rate estimate for a period of three months at the oil sands operation. The results are compared to the database in order to assess the frameworkM-bM-^@M-^Ys prediction accuracy, and to the old method adopted by the staff at the mine to show the superiority of this approach. This framework generates TPGOH productivity estimates that are within 0.1% accuracy of the database records, while the old method generated estimates that were up to 18% off. Due to the probabilistic nature of this simulation method, several replications are run. The program in this thesis is found to achieve desired accuracy and confidence levels for complex scenarios in a matter of seconds. Using EFH, a planning tool similar to the old method is produced, and yields results with an error of less than 4%. Recommendations for future work are provided, and center around two topics: properly characterizing the details of mine advancement within bench faces and movement of dump locations, as well as properly characterizing the dispatch logic in order to be able to correctly predict empty truck travel times.

    ns5:abstract "Intensive care units (ICU) are providing increasing amounts of palliative care. However, a lack of consistency in palliative methods within critical care is reported to create negative end-of-life experiences for patients and their families. Subsequently, there is increasing interest to develop initiatives that improve the quality of palliative care in the critical care setting. The purpose of this qualitative descriptive study was to explore what critical care nurses perceive as facilitators of and barriers to providing quality palliative care in critical care. Eleven critical care nurses working within a general systems intensive care unit (ICU) in a large western Canadian hospital participated in this study. Semi-structured individual interviews were conducted with each participant and data was interpreted using thematic analysis. Key barriers that were identified include ineffective communication, difficulties with end-of-life decision making, not respecting a personM-bM-^@M-^Ys wishes, the lifesaving mentality of critical care, a lack of palliative care education, and barriers related to the critical care environment. Identified facilitators of quality palliative care include advance care planning, effective communication, palliative care education, contributions of the interdisciplinary team, palliative order sets, and promoting an environment that is conducive to quality palliative care. Additionally, key messages that arose include the reality of mortality, moral distress, the components of a M-bM-^@M-^\good death,M-bM-^@M-^] connectedness and the nurseM-bM-^@M-^Ys relational narrative, and the great potential for improvement. These findings point to the importance of promoting advance care planning, early integration of the palliative approach, palliative education, effective communication, palliative care orders sets, critical care environments that are conducive to quality palliative experiences, fostering the nurse-patient relationship, and combatting moral distress. It is anticipated that the results of this study will provide insight into the initiatives and resources that are required to enhance the quality of palliative critical care within the local context.

    ns2:abstract """This postphenomenological study is a timely investigation into the hidden curriculum of surveillance technology in schools. Drawing on literature from the fields of Surveillance Studies, Education, and Philosophy of Technology the purpose of this inquiry is to expose the hidden curricula of electronic surveillance technology in schools and to bring to light the new ethical demands and responsibilities that come with it. In the unveiling of surveillance technologyM-bM-^@M-^Ys hidden curricula the intent is not to draw attention to the technology itself, but rather the world which is convened through the technology. This study is also concerned with uncovering the beliefs and values that are built into surveillance technology and examining what this says about the about the purpose of education, the role of the teacher in the classroom, and the shape and significance of tomorrowM-bM-^@M-^Ys learning environments for students.  As such this work challenges the inherent values of the instrumental mindset which are displacing a pedagogical and moral orientation by prioritizing the values of control, efficiency, and conformity over other important values such as care, trust, autonomy, and critical thinking.  
Drawing on the phenomenological research methods of  Max van Manen's (2014) M-bM-^@M-^\phenomenology of practiceM-bM-^@M-^] and Adams and TurvilleM-bM-^@M-^Ys M-bM-^@M-^\postphenomenology of practiceM-bM-^@M-^] (forthcoming 2018) this study is predominately based on the analysis of hermeneutic phenomenological interviews of teachers and students who have experienced and used classroom management software. By attending to the peculiarities of  human-(surveillance)technology-world relations and the amplification and reduction structures that come with it, this study draws attention to the many ways in which surveillance technology may alter the ways in which we perceive and engage with the world. This includes the ways in which the relational, situational, and affective dimensions of pedagogy are altered every time a teacher solves a problem by grabbing for a mouse rather than directly dealing with the conflict or problem at hand. In this way this study reveals how surveillance technology not only shapes how teachers and students perceive and interact with the world, it also has the potential to shape a teacherM-bM-^@M-^Ys way of being in the classroom. 
This study is important not only because it raises important questions about how and why surveillance technology is used to watch over youth; it is also important for bringing both Philosophy of Technology and Surveillance Studies research into the field of education. This inquiry is a departure from the traditional concerns of the field of educational technology in that it offers new and critical perspectives on the numerous unintended consequences of using surveillance technology to watch over youth. Importantly this study draws attention to the many unexpected ways in which these tools silently but forcefully form inclinations within which new dominant pedagogical practices and routines emerge. The intent is not the abandonment of these tools, but rather to consider the ways in which we can live with these tools in ways that minimize the negative impact of the unintended consequences of these tools. By alerting teachers to the ways in which surveillance technology selectively extends and constrains what teachers see of their students, this may provoke a deeper understanding of how everyday interactions with surveillance technology may shape and alter the pedagogical choices made by teachers in the classroom.  Most importantly, this inquiry calls on us to reconsider how and why we use surveillance technology to watch over youth and to reflect upon our ethical priorities to ensure that it is the care of the child that is at the center of surveillance practices.

    ns2:abstract "Severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant cause of death and disability around the world. Management based on Brain Trauma Foundation (BTF) guidelines is widely accepted and thought to improve outcomes. The objectives of this thesis are to provide an overview of adherence to BTF guidelines as a whole and specifically for intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring, to explore which factors influence adherence and to study the effects of guideline-based management on outcomes. Firstly, we conducted a search of relevant electronic bibliographic databases. Twenty articles met inclusion/exclusion criteria out of 666 papers screened. All were cohort studies. Wide variation of adherence to BTF guidelines was observed with a median of 60.7% (range 0-100%). The lowest median adherence was observed with surgical management (14%), while the highest was observed with oxygenation (100%), steroid (97.8%) and blood pressure recommendation (92.3%). Variability was primarily explained by the variation in strength of evidence of each recommendation. Treating patients with higher severity of injury and treatment in a level 1 trauma center positively influenced adherence. Adherence was not associated with improved crude mortality [OR: 0.82, (95% CI: 0.60-1.12) or adjusted mortality [OR: 0.95, (95% CI: 0.88-1.02). However, beneficial effects were observed in subgroup analysis through implementation of a guidelines-based protocol in terms of in-hospital crude mortality as well as adherence to specific recommendations; nutrition, Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP), oxygen (O2) and cerebral perfusion threshold, but low level of evidence and study heterogeneity limit the generalizability of the results. Secondly, We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients with severe blunt TBI registered in Alberta Trauma Registry between 2000 to 2013. Patients who died in the emergency department and patients from provinces other than Alberta were excluded. Outcomes were adherence rate with 3rd edition of the BTF guidelines, overall in-hospital mortality, and length of stay in hospital and intensive care unit (ICU). In this cohort, the BTF guideline adherence rate for ICP monitoring was 30%. Adherence rates increased with younger age, high ISS score, lower Glasgow Coma Score (GCS), abnormal CT head, craniotomy, admission to neurocritical care unit, and absence of alcohol intoxication or cardiac arrest. After adjusting for potential confounders adherence was associated with higher mortality (OR 2.01, 95% CI: 1.56-2.59, p<0.001) and increase ICU and hospital length of stay (p<0.001).  Overall, the literature indicate that adherence to BTF guidelines is variable and further study is required to strengthen the current evidence and identify factors related to adherence with guidelines include professional prospective. Adherence to BTF guidelines for ICP monitoring in severe TBI in Alberta was low, varied across centers and was associated with higher mortality and morbidity. ICP insertion may be an indicator of TBI severity, alternatively the current BTF criteria for ICP monitoring may fail to identify patients likely to benefit. Further study is required to refine the indications of ICP monitoring in TBI patients." ;

    ns8:abstract "Arab immigrants have received relatively less academic attention than other minority groups in Canada. Most research on Arab learners in Canada examines their language difficulties as ESL learners. This study contributes to a better understanding of the cross-cultural and educational experiences of Arab youth in diaspora. From a theoretical perspective, it draws substantially on Du BoisM-bM-^@M-^Ys notion of double consciousness, which addresses people who experience a sense of M-bM-^@M-^XtwonessM-bM-^@M-^Y as they are trapped between two worlds. This study not only acknowledges the wealth of Du BoisM-bM-^@M-^Ys and GilroyM-bM-^@M-^Ys models, but also attempts to expand those models to wider, more encompassing, and multi-ethnic articulations of Black Atlantic geopolitics. This study examines ways in which Arab-Canadian second-generation high school students respond to Arab Anglophone immigrant literature. It introduces and discusses the works of some Arab Anglophone writers, and shows how the studentsM-bM-^@M-^Y responses underpin their sense of identity, particularly of being Canadian. In doing so, this study explores how ethnicity and culture inform responses to literary texts, and demonstrates how ethnicity and religion define second-generation studentsM-bM-^@M-^Y understandings of assimilation and social justice.

    ns3:abstract "Membrane technology is currently widely used for separation of ions, colloids, organic matter and macromolecules. Among various membrane processes, nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO) with thin film nanocomposite (TFC) polyamide (PA) membrane at the heart of the separation process is being increasingly employed for sea and brackish water treatment and wastewater reclamation. Over the past decade, the increasing need to implement highly cost and energy efficient membranes processes has accelerated the research effort to fabricate advanced composite membranes with enhanced permeation, thermomechanical, and antifouling properties. In the present research, systematic studies were conducted to fabricate high performance composite PA membrane with improved thermal stability and antifouling propensity. First, the effects of synthesis conditions and chemical additives were studied on the permeation properties of the TFC PA membranes. The composite membranes were prepared by interfacial polymerization (IP) reaction between meta-phenylene diamine (MPD)-aqueous and trimesoyl chloride (TMC)-organic solvents (such as heptane, hexane and cyclohexane) at the surface of polyethersulfone (PES) microporous support. Several influential factors including the concentration of the reacting monomers, reaction time and temperature, thermal curing temperature, and the concentration of chemical additive such as surfactant, pH regulator, co-solvents in the water-based monomer solution was investigated using design of experiment (DOE) methodology. The results revealed that the final permselectivity of a TFC PA membrane is remarkably dependent of its surface physicochemical properties, structural characteristics and the complex internal free volumes which can all be influenced by synthesis conditions. The findings of the first stage of this research provided valuable insight and useful guidelines for the development of TFC PA membranes with wide range of water permeation and salt rejection. These findings were used in the second stage of the research where robust and high performance nanocomposite membranes were prepared by incorporation of metal oxide nanoparticles (NPs) to the membrane structure. Initially, nanocomposite microporous membranes were prepared by integration of indium tin oxide (ITO) NPs to the PES matrix via phase inversion process. The resulting PES-ITO membranes demonstrated higher thermal stability and antifouling porosity comparted to pristine PES membranes when tested with industrially produced water. Finally, titanium dioxide (TiO2) NPs were effectively incorporated to the PA active layer using a combination of biphasic solvothermal (BST) reaction and IP reaction. The resulting thin film nanocomposite (TFN) PA-TiO2 membranes showed an enhanced thermal stability and anti-biofouling characteristics compared to base TFC PA membranes." ;

    ns4:abstract "Advancements in data acquisition technologies and the desire for rich data has led to an increase in the size of data collected from modern analytical instruments. With the aid of chemometric techniques, researchers are still able to glean more useful information from these kinds of data  than they can with conventional interpretation tools. These chemometric models also benefit immensely from methods that eliminate redundant information.  To make these feature selection methods efficient, strategies to reduce the size of the data prior to their implementation are also desirable. However, in attempting to reduce the data volume, there is an associated risk of information loss or distortion. In chromatography, where   multivariate detectors such as mass spectrometers are used, data reduction methods currently available generally resort to elimination of some dimension of the data.This dissertation presents new approaches to data size reduction for chromatographic data where multivariate detectors are used. The Unique Ion Filter (UIF) was developed as a data reduction strategy for reducing data size without altering the multivariate nature as well as the chemical information in the data. Two types of UIF were developed namely, UIF1D and UIF2D for one-dimensional and comprehensive chromatography where multivariate detectors are employed. UIF1D and UIF2D were successfully applied to complex data and were found to be very useful. Segmented total ion spectrum (STIS) was also developed to achieve data reduction with partial preservation of retention information for gas chromatography data. STIS is presented as an alignment-free data reduction method which allows inter-laboratory comparison of chromatograms so long as the same anchor compounds are used. Cluster resolution feature selection (CR-FS) was developed as an objective feature selection algorithm. Hitherto, there existed no guidance to the determination of the two main parameters needed for full automation of CR-FS. This has prevented true automation of the implementation of this algorithm. The development of an empirical approach to guide the selection of these two critical parameters is also accomplished in this dissertation. Applications of feature selection tools beyond the realm of chromatography are also explored. It is the desire of X- ray crystallographers to be able to predict the crystal structure of crystalline compounds from their elemental compositions. A machine learning approach to this problem was also explored using CR-FS to determine elemental properties that can guide such predictions. Rapid identification of micro-organism is highly desirable. This task increases in difficulty as one moves down the taxonomic rank.   Feature selection with CR-FS in combination with matrix assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectroscopy (MALDI-TOFMS) data presents an opportunity for high throughput and automated method for bacterial identification. The potential of this approach is also explored." ;

    ns6:abstract """The present research was conducted with the intent of evaluating the degradation of OCTG (Oil Country Tubular Goods) steel used in SAGD (Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage) applications, and developing a promising surface modification method and a novel composite coating using a technique that will have a high possibility of commercialization to improve the corrosion resistance of the OCTG steel in SAGD applications. The corrosion mechanism of OCTG steel in the sour environment consisting of H2S and CO2 was fully understood but the performance of the coated (Ni-P coating) and uncoated OCTG steel in a real SAGD operation was not evaluated till now. So in this study, at the first, the coated (electroless Ni-P coating) and uncoated slotted liner used in a real SAGD operation for three months were evaluated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and optical stereoscopic microscope (OSM) from cross section and surface of the samples. Elemental mapping analysis of the corrosion scale formed on the samples was done from the cross section in order to have a better perspective on performance of the coated and uncoated slotted liner in SAGD operation. Results revealed that applying the Ni-P coating considerably decreased the thickness of the corrosion scale formed on the samples. Also a condensed layer of nickel sulfide formed on the coated samples which can function as a barrier against the diffusion of the corrosive ions from the environment to the substrate. However, the corrosion product formed on the uncoated sample was very porous.\r
Alloy carbon steel is of great interest in oil sands industry due to its desired strength, flexibility, and low cost. However, the corrosion of this widely used steel in corrosive environments is a great concern. Indeed, finding and applying a promising coating on carbon steel which is used in sour environment (including H2S and CO2) have always attracted a significant attention of oil sands industry specifically SAGD industry. The sour environments consisting of H2S and CO2 accelerate the corrosion process and degradation of the carbon steel, resulting in replacement of the OCTG in oil sands industry. \r
As a matter of fact, nitrogen has a substantial effect on the corrosion behavior of steels. In part two of this study, gas nitriding at 850 M-BM-0C and 950 M-BM-0C was applied to the carbon steel. The corrosion resistance behavior of the modified samples was investigated by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and potentiodynamic polarization tests at the simulated sour environment. After the corrosion test, optical microscope and scanning electron microscopy were employed to evaluate the surface morphology of the samples modified by gas nitriding technique. The results of the polarization testes revealed that the localized corrosion of the carbon steel specimens modified by nitrogen decreased significantly. In addition, the polarization resistance of the carbon steel samples increased considerably after applying the gas nitriding process. However, due to the lack feasibility of using this technique for the industry, I shifted from the gas nitriding to a more applicable technique - electroless plating technique. With this in mind, Ni-P-GO (graphene oxide) composite coating was applied on carbon steel by using electroless plating technique. The electrochemical behavior of the Ni-P-GO was evaluated by potentiodynamic polarization test and EIS in a simulated sour environment saturated by H2S and CO2. Morphology, microstructure, elemental analysis, and phase analysis of the coating are investigated by OSM, FESEM equipped with EDS, and X-ray diffraction technique. Microscopic images taken from the Ni-P-GO composite coating revealed that GO nanosheets distributed uniformly through the coating. Electrochemical tests showed that adding graphene oxide nanosheets significantly improved the corrosion resistance of electroless Ni-P coating in the sour environment. Also, results of the EIS test revealed that adding GO nanosheets increased the coating resistance of the electroless Ni-P coating from 1 KM-NM-).cm2 to around 12.3 KM-NM-).cm2.""" ;

    ns2:abstract "The most widely used method for desalination, the process of removing salts and minerals from saltwater for human consumption and irrigation, is membrane technology. There are various types of membrane technologies, but the use of thin film nanocomposite (TFN) polyamide (PA) membranes for nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO) are central to seawater and wastewater treatment. TFN membranes incorporate nanoparticles (NPs) into their PA layer which are able to increase the membranes contaminant rejection, mechanical strength, and water flux, resulting in a more efficient separation process that produces water with higher quality. This thesis focuses on the synthesis and integration of conductive indium tin oxide (ITO) NPs into membranes with the goal of demonstrating improved thermal stability and hydrophilicity.    The NPs are dispersed in the organic solution during synthesis of the TFN membrane, however the tendency of NPs to form large aggregates has been a major limitation to their successful integration. The challenge of aggregation extends to widespread applications of NPs, where utilizing monodisperse and stable suspension of NPs is essential. The aggregation of NPs becomes more challenging when there is less affinity between the dispersed phase (NPs) and the continuous phase (solvent), such as, dispersion of hydrophilic metal oxide NPs into a nonpolar (organic) solvent. The objective of the first part of this study is to systematically investigate the synergistic effects of eight dispersion parameters on the size an  d stability of indium tin oxide (ITO) NPs in heptane. The matrix of experimentation was designed using an L18 Taguchi method. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the experimental results revealed that the most significant factors on the size and stability of NPs were the mass of ITO NPs and the volume of the dispersing agent. Taguchi signal-to-noise (SN) ratio analysis was used to determine the optimal factor levels for the preparation of well-dispersed and stable NP suspensions. Confirmation tests were carried out at the suggested levels of the ANOVA predictive model, and highly stable ITO NPs in heptane with the size distribution of 43.0M-bM-^@M-^S68.3 nm were obtained. The results of the parametric study can be used for a broad range of applications where effective stabilization of metal oxide NPs in organic solvents is desired. The ITO NP suspension is utilized in the second part of the work to synthesize ITO TFN membranes. The presence of ITO NPs at a weight percentage of 0.02% were shown to nearly double the water flux of the control membrane during the treatment of salt water, from 25.3 LMH to 41.5 LMH, while maintaining a 98% rejection of salt. Contact angle measurements showed an increase in the concentration of ITO NPs in the PA layer successfully increased the hydrophilicity of the membrane. The incorporation of ITO NPs was shown to increase the zeta potential of the PA layer across a wide range of pH measurements. Thermogravimetric analysis demonstrated that the ITO TFN membrane demonstrated greater thermal stability, with a thermal degradation temperature of 472M-BM-0C compared to a temperature of 455M-BM-0C, than the control membrane. Finally, field emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy acquisition system were used to show well integration of the ITO NPs in the PA layer without the formation of defects." ;

    ns4:abstract "Quantitative relaxation mapping allows for direct non-invasive tissue quantification with removal of variations arising from RF fields and non-uniform coil sensitivity profiles.  T2 may be quantified using multi-echo spin echo sequences; however, in practical imaging situations, imperfect refocussing due to RF interference and imperfect slice profiles results in contamination of the signal decay curve by contributions from indirect and stimulated echoes.    Modelling of the multi-echo spin echo sequence by either Bloch equations or Extended Phase Graph (EPG) allows for indirect and stimulated echo compensation (ISEC).  In this work, it is demonstrated that EPG-ISEC and Bloch-ISEC yield very similar but systematically different T2 results. EPG fitting provides reasonably accurate T2, but is limited by poor accuracy in resulting flip angles, and T2 errors increase when flip angles are provided. Bloch simultaneous fitting of T2 and flip angle provides excellent results, but can be limited by multiple solutions which can be overcome by including a flip angle map.    Despite the availability of methods to compensate for indirect and stimulated echoes, exponential fitting remains persistent.   It is common to discard the first or all odd echoes, to improve fitting.  However, it is demonstrated in this work that this is insufficient to remove stimulated echo contamination, and errors in T2 fitting will remain significant, and will vary with T2, flip angle, and echo train length.    In clinical practice, relaxation weighted images are routinely acquired, but quantification of relaxation times typically requires additional specialized pulse sequences and hence additional imaging time, which is not typically feasible in standard clinical practice.  In this work, it is demonstrated that the Bloch-based ISEC approach permits T2 to be quantified using only a Proton Density-weighted and a T2-weighted fast spin echo image and a flip angle map.  With the addition of a T1 weighted image to the protocol, simultaneous T1 and T2 quantification is demonstrated.   This approach may enable the introduction of quantitative relaxation into radiology protocols without substantial time penalties." ;

    ns1:abstract "Critical care nephrology is a rapidly growing and developing field within critical care medicine. It encompasses the entire spectrum of mild acute kidney injury (AKI), usually represented by a change in biochemical markers (i.e., serum creatinine and urea) or alterations in clinical parameters (i.e., urine output). There currently exists no specific treatment for AKI; therapy consists of supportive care and prevention of further kidney insults. However, despite these measures, kidney injury can at times progress to overt kidney failure. When this occurs, kidney dialysis is often necessary, occurring in the form of renal replacement therapy (RRT). RRT may take many different forms, from intermittent RRT (IRRT) to continuous RRT (CRRT). Each form may be more or less appropriate, depending on the severity of illness and complexity of the patient. For our sickest patients, therapy is delivered in a continuous fashion, analogous to our own intrinsic kidney function. This provides a more gradual form of RRT, which may be better tolerated by more critically ill patients. CRRT is a complex, costly and highly specialized form of life-sustaining therapy, reserved for our most advanced intensive care units (ICUs) and our most critically ill patients. CRRT must be delivered with utmost care, to ensure the safe and high quality delivery of this life-sustaining therapy. However, there currently exist no routine markers to measure the quality of the delivery and performance of CRRT, nor to benchmark its delivery. This is an important gap in the field of critical care nephrology, and one that this research program sought to address. The first objective of this program was to review the current state of evidence for quality and safety within critical care nephrology. To accomplish this, I conducted a review of the literature to evaluate what quality and safety measures have already been developed and evaluated. I identified that while there have been advances in better defining AKI and that numerous organizations exist to continue to advance quality within critical care nephrology, the quality of care received by patients either at risk of or who have developed AKI remains suboptimal. Additionally, I found that evidence-informed quality indicators (QIs) for CRRT care have not been rigorously evaluated. The results of this review informed the second objective of my research program, which was to identify which QIs currently exist in the literature. To identify potential QIs for CRRT care, I performed a systematic review. I initially screened 8,374 citations from five citation databases as well as from the grey literature. Ultimately 133 studies fulfilled eligibility, and a total of 18 potential QIs across the Donabedian framework of measures of quality were identified. However, these QIs where characterized by heterogeneous definitions, varying quality of derivation and limited evaluation. I concluded that further study was needed in order to develop a concise inventory of QIs that may be applied to CRRT care. This, in turn, informed the third objective of my research program, which was to develop a prioritized list of the most important of these QIs which may be utilized across any CRRT program. To develop this prioritized list, I embarked on a modified Delphi process. A Delphi process is a structured communication method which relies on a panel of experts, consisting of several rounds where experts respond to questions and then have anonymized summary of responses from previous rounds, with the purpose of converging on the M-bM-^@M-^XcorrectM-bM-^@M-^Y answer. I conducted two internet-based rounds and a third in-person meeting for my modified Delphi process, and ultimately arrived at a prioritized list of 13 QIs for CRRT care. These 13 QIs consisted of two QIs relating to CRRT structure (filter life and specialized care team), seven QIs relating to CRRT processes (delivered dose, downtime, fluid management, medication adjustment, time from prescription to therapy, therapy prescription and small solute clearance) and four QIs of CRRT outcomes (adverse events, bleeding, catheter dysfunction, catheter line-associated bloodstream infections). However, there was disagreement on the precise definitions of these QIs, and uncertainty on which of these may be most easily operationalized in clinical and educational practices. In summary, this research program first evaluated the current state of quality within critical care nephrology, and then developed a prioritized list of 13 QIs for CRRT care. While consensus existed on the importance of these 13 QIs, future work will be required to better define the QIs, to establish benchmarks for bedside care and to operationalize these QIs into our healthcare data management systems. This will in turn create a CRRT Quality Dashboard that may be used to ensure the safe and high-quality delivery of CRRT care to critically ill patients." ;

    ns8:abstract "Child care utilization in Canada has increased dramatically in the last two decades. Child care centres provide opportunities for the promotion of healthy eating habits among a great number of young children. Child care educators play a major part in the promotion of healthy eating and behaviour change in children. However, there is room for improving the promotion of healthy eating in child care centres and by child care educators. Furthermore, there is a need for programs aimed at promoting healthy eating, with a special emphasis on child care educators in the child care setting.   The two main aims of this research were to conduct a needs assessment through: 1) a consultation with key informants in the child care sector to explore and identify the educational needs of child care educators in the promotion of healthy eating in child care; and 2) a rapid review of interventions designed to promote childrenM-bM-^@M-^Ys consumption of vegetables and fruits in child cares. First, a cross-sectional online survey was used to consult with a group of key informants on their perceptions of and recommendations for child care educatorsM-bM-^@M-^Y educational needs in the promotion of healthy eating in child cares. Second, a rapid review methodology was used to guide a literature review on interventions aimed at promoting childrenM-bM-^@M-^Ys consumption of vegetables and fruits in child care centres. Through the consultation with key informants, this study found there is a need for further training of child care educators in the promotion of healthy eating. In addition, other influential factors need to be addressed to enhance the promotion of healthy eating in child care centres. The rapid review revealed that comprehensive healthy eating interventions targeting children, parents, child care staff and the centreM-bM-^@M-^Ys food environment were more successful than single interventions in promoting healthy eating in child care centres. The findings of this research bring insight into what is needed for the promotion of healthy eating in child cares, and what are the most effective approaches to promote healthy eating in this setting. The findings from the needs assessment will inform the development of future programs aimed at promoting healthy eating in child cares." ;

    ns2:abstract "Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a neuromuscular disorder characterized by early involvement of muscle weakness. FSHD is most commonly caused by a deletion of a subset of D4Z4 macrosatellite repeats at the locus located on chromosome 4q35. Within each D4Z4 repeat unit is a double homeobox sequence encoding the DUX4 protein. In FSHD patients, mis-expression of DUX4 results in the production of a pathogenic protein and causes a transcriptional deregulation cascade which triggers muscle atrophy, apoptosis, and oxidative stress. Currently, no curative treatment options for FSHD patients have been established, further illustrating the importance of determining the biological impact of DUX4 suppression via antisense oligonucleotides. Implication for antisense oligonucleotides in FSHD could help towards progressing the development of therapeutic approaches. Using in vitro methods, in immortalized control myoblasts and immortalized FSHD patient muscle cells, three culture media additives were investigated, fetal bovine serum (FBS), knockout serum replacement (KOSR) and dexamethasone, to determine their effects on DUX4 expression in culture. Various RT-conditions were also examined for sensitive detection of DUX4. In addition, suppression of DUX4 was examined via RNase H-mediated degradation using locked nucleic acids (LNA)-DNA chimeras, called gapmers, targeting DUX4. In this work, I have shown that SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (RT) and GoTaqM-BM-. G2 green master mix is the most sensitive cDNA synthesis strategy to use for detection of DUX4. Supplementing culture medium with dexamethasone enabled better detection of DUX4 expression in immortalized healthy and FSHD myoblasts. Transfection with LNA gapmers 1, 1*, 3*, 4, 6, and 7, all which target exon 3 of the DUX4 mRNA, suppress the expression of DUX4 in immortalized FSHD patient muscle cells. Transfection with LNA gapmers 1 and 3 was also found to change the localization of MuRF1 in the nucleus of FSHD myotubes. In addition, I found that PITX1 expression in immortalized FSHD patient muscle cells is not suppressed by LNA gapmers targeting DUX4. These results establish a sensitive detection strategy and culture method for detection of DUX4, identify potential LNA gapmers sequences which prevent DUX4 expression and change the localization of MuRF1 in nucleus and indicate that PITX1 per se is not a direct target of DUX4. This thesis also outlines the therapeutic potential of antisense chemistries, specifically LNA gapmers, in FSHD targeting DUX4." ;

    ns3:abstract "Nanomaterials have gained interest due to their unique physical and chemical phenomena that is only observed for materials in this size regime. In the biohealth sector, gold nanoparticles are good platforms for use in curative treatments and detection of cancer and disease.  However, their effectiveness depends on how well they are internalized and destined to travel in cells.  One pathway gold nanoparticles use to travel in cells is clathrin mediated endocytosis. In this pathway, gold nanoparticles are encapsulated in membrane vesicles that undergo fusions and maturations with four intracellular vesicles (endosomes) before being directed to the lysosome for degradation.  There are four proteins which M-bM-^@M-^\markM-bM-^@M-^] the pathway; Rab5 (Early Endosome), Rab11 (Recycling Endosome), Rab7 (Late Endosome), and LAMP-1 (Lysosome).   In this work, we first studied the distribution and co-localization of the four proteins which M-bM-^@M-^\markM-bM-^@M-^] the pathway to determine the extent to which these markers are unique for specific endosomes or co-exist with other markers on endosomes. This study was done for C2C12 and A549 cells to determine if the distribution and co-localization of markers was cell type specific. We determined that markers are not unique for specific endosomes and markers can co-exist in the same endosome, the distribution and co-localization of markers in cells is cell type specific and the distribution of ternary complexes varies with cell type.  We then studied the time dependent internalization and uptake of phospholipid coated gold nanoparticles and the extent of co-localization of phospholipid coated gold nanoparticles with markers in C2C12 and A549 cells.  C2C12 and A549 cells are able to continuously internalize phospholipid coated gold nanoparticles with time, but to different extents. It was also observed that the ability for cells to withhold phospholipid coated gold nanoparticles in a nanoparticle free extracellular environment depends on cell type. We also found that binary and ternary complex formation in A549 and C2C12 cells varied. A fraction of binary complexes consisting of one marker and phospholipid coated gold nanoparticles may also include ternary complexes in both cell types. This work was consistent with results obtained in Chapter 3.  As we were able to effectively study the endocytic pathway and uptake of phospholipid coated gold nanoparticles in two different cell types, we chose to study M-NM-1-synuclein (M-NM-1-syn) in SH-SY5Y cells. M-NM-1-syn is a protein associated with ParkinsonM-bM-^@M-^Ys disease; until recently, oligomeric forms of the protein are understood to be toxic and are the current focus of study for scientists for detection and curative methods. Thus, we applied the same logic and methods in Chapters 3 and 4 to study oligomeric forms of M-NM-1-synuclein. We studied the time dependent uptake of oligomers, distribution and extent of co-localization of markers, extent of co-localization of oligomers, and the extent of co-localization of oligomers with markers in SH-SY5Y cells. The oligomers chosen for this study were monomers, as well as engineered dimers and tetramers. We found each oligomer was able to passively enter cells and each oligomer was observed to also undergo clathrin mediated endocytosis. Each oligomer had shown to be internalized and taken up in cells in a time dependent manner; however, the degree of aggregation of monomers decreases the most with time.  Real-time observation of monomers, dimers, and tetramers of M-NM-1-synuclein in SH-SY5Y cells was also studied. This was the first time real-time observation was to be undertaken for this study; we determined an experiment consisting of 50 images is sufficient to estimate the diffusion time, diffusion coefficient, and temporal auto correlation amplitude. We also observed that the diffusion time of oligomers in cells was proportional to the size of the oligomer.  In this work, membrane trafficking and possible roles of endocytic proteins was studied along with the endocytic uptake of two nanomaterial systems of interest for potential therapeutic and diagnostic applications. This is the first ICS analysis of endocytic marker and gold nanoparticle association and distribution and the first successful quantitative three color co-localization performed in-vitro in C2C12 and A549 cells, using Image Correlation Spectroscopy analysis. The work presented in this thesis significantly contributes to the field of nanotechnology and cell biology.  The work in this thesis was accomplished using Image Correlation Spectroscopy analysis of images obtained using a laser scanning confocal microscope." ;

    ns3:abstract "Mammography is the most frequently used imaging method for the detection of breast cancer. Despite the key role of mammography in the breast cancer detection, false-negative diagnosis by mammograms ranges from 4 to 34%. Positron emission tomography (PET), a tracer based molecular imaging method is an alternative to mammography for the detection of breast cancer. The most commonly used PET tracer [18F]-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ([18F]-FDG) also provides false-positive and false-negative diagnosis of breast cancer.  Mammalian hexose transporters (GLUTs) facilitate the transport of hexoses from the extracellular spacer to intracellular space and vice versa. To date, 14 different types of GLUTs, which exhibit difference in substrate specificity, are known. The ubiquitously expressed transporter protein GLUT1 transports [18F]-FDG. Enzymatic phosphorylation of [18F]-FDG with hexokinase prevents the back-transport of [18F]-FDG by GLUT1. Due to minimal or complete lack of expression of GLUT1 in some breast cancer cells and ubiquitous expression of GLUT1 in some normal cells, relatively lower accumulation of [18F]-FDG was observed in breast cancer cells over normal cells. After the discovery of GLUT5 in many breast cancer cells, tracers targeting this transporter were developed for the imaging of breast cancer. Unfortunately, these tracers were back transported from the breast cancer cells due to their inability to undergo enzymatic phosphorylation by hexokinase. Tracers that target the GLUT5 transporter protein and undergo enzymatic phosphorylation in the presence of hexokinase could significantly improve the efficiency of PET or optical imaging in the detection of certain types of breast cancers. This thesis comprises our studies of synthesis and biological evaluations of novel 2,5-anhydro-D-mannitol (2,5-AM)-based scaffolds, to examine their ability to serve as tracers in the molecular imaging of early stage breast cancer. Chapter 1 of this thesis provides a broad introduction to the hexose-based tracer development for the molecular imaging of breast cancer. Structural requirement of hexoses for the efficient GLUT-substrate binding is also overviewed in this Chapter. In Chapter 2, modification of the C-3 position of 2,5-AM via diastereoselective epoxide ring-opening of 2,5:3,4-dianhydro-D-allitol is described. Chapter 2 also discusses the solvent polarity effects on this epoxide ring-opening process. Chapter 3 presents the biological evaluation of 3-fluoro-3-deoxy-2,5-anhydro-D-mannitol whose 18F-labeled version could potentially be used as a PET tracer for the detection of breast cancer. In addition, Chapter 3 also deals with the structure-activity relationship between GLUT5 and the C-3 modified 2,5-AM derivatives. D-Fructose and D-glucose transport inhibition into EMT-6 cells by C-3 modified 2,5-AM derivatives, followed by control experiments are used to determine the structural requirement of the C-3 modified 2,5-AM derivatives for GLUT recognition.  In Chapter 4, synthesis and biological evaluations of a new probe 3-(N-(4-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-7-yl))amino-2,5-anhydro-D-mannitol are described, along with docking studies performed by collaborators. Our studies demonstrate that this is the first GLUT5 targeting probe that exhibits low efflux from the murine breast tumor cells. Chapter 5 comprises the synthesis and biological evaluation of C-3 modified 2,5-AM bearing near-infrared emitting dyes as probes for the optical imaging of breast cancer." ;

    ns6:abstract "Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary bone malignancy with a high incidence in children and adolescents. Current treatment strategies (surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy) has improved the overall survival rate of patients with primary OS. However, the survival rate of patients with metastatic disease still remains poor. Therefore, understanding the biology of OS progression would be of key importance to identify markers with prognostic value and potential therapeutic targets for OS. Deregulation of the Wnt signaling pathway is known to be implicated in OS. However, the role of M-NM-2-catenin (key regulatory component of Wnt signaling) in this cancer is not clear. While some studies support the involvement of M-NM-2-catenin in OS, others show the contrary. However, to date studies have investigated the role of M-NM-2-catenin rather than Active Beta Catenin (ABC), a subpopulation of M-NM-2-catenin that is transcriptionally active. ABC transcribes the Wnt target genes that are involved in cell proliferation, invasiveness and hence promotes cancer.   This study investigated the role of M-NM-2-catenin and ABC in OS progression using two pairs of cell lines representing OS progression. Western blot analysis, immunofluorescence analysis and high content analysis were carried out for the determination of cellular level and sub-cellular localization of M-NM-2-catenin and ABC. Our results suggested an association between ABC and OS progression, whereas the total M-NM-2-catenin by itself was not associated with OS progression. Hence, this study demonstrated the potential role of ABC in OS progression." ;

    ns3:subject "Amygdala",
        "Anxiety",
        "NPY" ;
    ns2:abstract "Fear and anxiety are highly adaptive emotions that motivate species appropriate responses to threats: immediate and potential. Certain threats, such as ancestral predators, are highly predictable and can be recognized and addressed with innate (inherited) neural systems. This M-bM-^@M-^\genetic memoryM-bM-^@M-^] underlies human phobias (ex. fear of snakes) and allows individuals to recognize and effectively respond to conserved dangers, regardless of previous encounters.   Unlearned fear systems, however, have clear limitations, the most fundamental being their inability to recognize every conceivable danger. Plastic threat appraisal systems overcome this limitation. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is the principal brain site where learned associations between innocuous sensory cues and intrinsically aversive stimuli are formed (fear conditioning). Fear conditioning is though to model a key mechanism for identifying novel threats. Anxiety, a more sustained state of hyper-vigilance, is also mediated by the BLA and is most appropriate when threats are diffuse and not readily predicted by explicit cues.    In susceptible individuals, exposure to a severe unpredictable stressor can elicit a prolonged disordered anxiety state termed posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Although protective to a degree, PTSD substantially impairs normal functioning and is profoundly unpleasant for the sufferer. An important factor thought to protect some individuals from the deleterious effects of traumatic stress is Neuropeptide Y (NPY). BLA NPY infusions are highly anxiolytic in rodents, while repeated infusions produce plastic changes culminating in a long lasting low-anxiety state.   Glutamatergic Principal neurons (PN) are the BLAM-bM-^@M-^Ys majority neuron type (85%) and mediate its output. The remaining 15% are a diverse group of GABA interneurons that tightly regulate PN activity. The output of a population PNs signals fear and anxiety. We previously showed that NPY inhibits BLA PNs via postsynaptic NPY Y1 receptors (consistent with anxiolytic actions). Furthermore, Y1 selective agonists mimic NPYs acute in vivo anxiolytic effects. Surprisingly, selective activation of BLA Y2 receptors (Y2-R) increases anxiety by an (until now) unknown mechanism. The principal focus of this thesis is to mechanistically dissect Y2-R functions in the BLA. A secondary aim is to determine if and how Y2-Rs contribute to the overall anxiolytic actions of the full agonist NPY.  Y2-Rs are typically presynaptic and inhibit neurotransmitter release. We therefore, hypothesized Y2-Rs disinhibit PNs by decreasing BLA interneuron GABA release. To test this, we used slice-patch electrophysiology in rat BLA-containing brain slices. Application of the selective Y2-R agonist [ahx5-24]NPY decreased the frequency of PN miniature GABAA inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSC)s with no effect on amplitude (suggesting a presynaptic effect). Interestingly, in the absence of tetrodotoxin (TTX) [ahx5-24]NPY increased the frequency of large amplitude fast kinetic sIPSCs, suggesting disinhibition of another interneuron type.   To determine the Y2-R expressing interneuron type mediating the above effects, we used a mouse model engineered to express the TdTomato fluorophore under control of the Y2-R gene promoter. Immunohistochemistry studies suggested Y2-Rs are expressed exclusively on interneurons characterized by NPY and somatostatin (SOM) expression. SOM interneurons innervate PN dendrites and also target other interneuron types consistent with electrophysiology findings.   In addition to the above effects, [ahx5-24]NPY increased PN excitability (indicated by a decrease in the depolarizing current required to elicit action potentials). These findings are consistent with the in vivo anxiogenic effects of selective Y2-R agonists. Although [ahx5-24]NPY only slightly depolarized most PNs, it substantially increased PN input resistance, indicating a net closure of ion channels. We hypothesized these effects were due to reduced tonic GABAA-mediated inhibition. However voltage-clamp experiments indicated [ahx5-24]NPY reduced a PN G-protein coupled inward rectifying K+ conductance (GIRK). Subsequent experiments revealed this was due to reduced tonic GABAB-R activation. Since PNs express postsynaptic GABAB-Rs exclusively at their dendrites this effect is also consistent with actions on (Y2-R expressing) NPY/SOM interneurons. Surprisingly, this Y2-R action persisted in TTX, indicating it is largely action potential-independent. Ultimately this finding reveals a highly novel consequence of action potential-independent neurotransmission.    NPY-mediated plasticity requires the Ca2+-dependent phosphatase calcineurin (which mediates LTD-type learning and is expressed in dendrites). Dendritic GABAB-GIRKs facilitate the Mg2+ block of NMDA receptors and dampen plasticity. Thus Y2-Rs may function to disinhibit PN dendrites and facilitate Ca2+-dependent, NPY-mediated plasticity. [ahx5-24]NPY-mediated increases in PN calcium influx were revealed indirectly by an increase Ca2+ dependent slow after-hyperpolarization (sIAHP) K+ current in half of all responsive PNs." ;

    ns3:subject "Leak Detection",
        "Pipeline",
        "Strain Gauge" ;
    ns7:abstract "Pipelines are the most important liquid and gas transportation methods in various industries. They help to reduce the cost and to minimize the environmental impacts. However, the public maintains high resistance to pipelineM-bM-^@M-^Ys developments because they are exposed to the consequents of pipelineM-bM-^@M-^Ys leakages. Thus, pipeline operators must aim at zero leakage in their systems for publicsM-bM-^@M-^Y safety and also for gaining public support. However, leaks are inevitable due to various reasons, and pipeline operators can only reduce leak consequences by early detections. As a result, many leak detection systems (LDSs) have been developed. According to the study of Afzal, most of those systems suffered from both technical and economical problems when applied to complex pipeline systems. These LDSs systems are optimized to detect different leaks and also to minimize the costly false alarms; thus, they overlook small leaks, i.e. pinhole leaks. This thesis introduces a new LDS that will solve both technical and economic problems. The system includes a flexible membrane with a sensor printed on its surface. This membrane will be wrapped around the 36M-bM-^@M-^] pipe to capture the release products. Also, its sensor will detect the membraneM-bM-^@M-^Ys strain created by these products and send the signal to pipeline operators. For the system to be sensitive and cost effective, the membrane had to be optimized to achieve the longest lengths with the predefined thicknesses. Since this technology will be incorporated into to the protective wraps, the optimization procedure will use the material properties and the popular thicknesses of the protective wraps. To achieve the optimum design, the sensorsM-bM-^@M-^Y geometry was optimized first. Then, they were printed on a flexible membrane using a low-cost printer, conductive ink, and resistive ink. The sensors were designed as a half Wheatstone bridge because this setup gave the highest signal outputs under different loading conditions. The sensors were studied using the four points bending test, and the gauge factors were determined to be 4 and 7.85 for the conductive ink and resistive ink, respectively. Based on this information, a prototype of the membrane was manufactured. This prototype was subjected to the dimple test to evaluate its workability and to compare with the FEA model. Also, the full FEA model of the membrane with the sensor was created. This model was used to optimize the length and thickness of the membrane. The optimum design was achieved when the printed sensor can generate a signal with a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 30 dB under deformation. The simulation indicated that the elastomer membrane with the length of 8.5 ft and thickness of 0.03M-bM-^@M-^] can detect pinhole leak on the 36M-bM-^@M-^] pipe in 0.8 seconds." ;

Although significant advances in the synthesis of 1,2-cis-glycofuranosides have been made, there are still some challenges. In particular, almost no studies investigating the synthesis of 1,2-cis-xylofuranosides have been carried out. Previous studies by our group have demonstrated that the utility 2,3-O-xylylene protected arabinofuranosyl donors in the synthesis of 1,2-cis-(M-NM-2)-arabinofuranosides. Therefore, we wanted to expand this methodology to the synthesis of 1,2-cis-(M-NM-1)-xylofuranosides. Several 2,3-O-xylylene protected xylofuranosyl donors were synthesized, glycosylations employing them have been optimized and the substrate scope of the reaction has been explored. Finally, to demonstrate the utility of the methodology, a 5-deoxy-5-methylthio-M-NM-1-xylofuranose- (MTX) containing pentasaccharide fragment of mycobacterial LAM was synthesized." ;

    ns6:abstract "A unique borylative migration of heterocyclic enol perfluorosulfonates has been developed to access six-membered heterocyclic M-NM-1-substituted allylboronates in a stereoselective and efficient manner. The synthetic utility of the allylboronate intermediates was demonstrated by a highly diastereoselective aldehyde allylboration, an enantioselective and regiodivergent Suzuki-Miyaura cross coupling and the efficient synthesis of all four stereoisomers of mefloquine. Although the mechanism of this transformation is unknown (and is currently being studied), the utility of this method still needs to be explored further.   First, the application of this process towards the synthesis of all four stereoisomers of Vacquinol-1; a potential therapeutic agent for the brain cancer glioblastoma multiforme, will be described. Identified in 2014, the tested compounds were a mixture of stereoisomers. The synthetic strategy presented herein provides an efficient route to access each stereoisomer of Vacquinol-1 for the independent biological study of each compound. Moreover, analogs of Vacquinol-1 are readily accessible with the presented method. Next, efforts to expand the substrate scope of this transformation to five- and seven- membered heterocyclic substrates is disclosed. Efforts on the optimization of the amine base, chiral ligand and solvent to render the transformation enantioselective are presented." ;

    ns8:subject "GM1",
        "Gangliosides",
        "Huntington disease" ;
    ns1:abstract "Huntington disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that results in motor, cognitive and psychiatric deficits. The disease is caused by the expansion of a polyglutamine stretch in huntingtin (HTT), a ubiquitous protein with unclear functions.  The molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration in HD are complex and include transcriptional dysregulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired intracellular and axonal transport, as well as aberrant cell signaling and neurotransmission.  Previous work showed that the synthesis of ganglioside GM1, a lipid highly enriched in the brain, is also impaired in HD models. Decreased levels of GM1 contribute to heightened HD cells susceptibility to apoptosis, and chronic intra-ventricular infusion of GM1 reverts the pathological motor phenotype in already symptomatic transgenic models of HD. The dramatic therapeutic effects of GM1 are accompanied by phosphorylation of mutant huntingtin (mHTT) at Ser13 and Ser16, a post-translational modification that has been shown to decrease mHTT toxicity. This suggests that GM1 might be able to modify the course of HD and to provide therapeutic benefits that go beyond the treatment of motor symptoms. To test this hypothesis we investigated whether administration of GM1 affects neurodegeneration and disease progression in R6/2 mice, an established model of HD that displays profound motor deficits, early-onset neurodegeneration and premature death. In these mice, treatment with GM1 resulted in improved motor performance, accompanied by a significant attenuation of the neurodegenerative process. GM1 reduced the loss of striatal neurons and increased overall brain and striatal volume. In addition, GM1 displayed trophic effects on the brain white matter and restored the volume of the corpus callosum to normal levels.  Next, we determined whether GM1 improves cognitive and psychiatric-like symptoms in YAC128, a second transgenic model of HD, and Q140 mice, a knock-in mouse model. Both models display a slower disease progression, with respect to R6/2 mice, allowing for a more accurate analysis of non-motor behaviour. Significant attenuation of cognitive and psychiatric-like symptoms was observed in YAC128 mice after 14 days of treatment and in Q140 mice after 28 days of treatment with GM1. Both models returned to WT performance levels on tests of anxiety, cognition, and depression, when treated with GM1.  One issue that could limit the therapeutic use of GM1 is its poor ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Although intra-ventricular or intra-thecal administration of GM1 is feasible, development of M-bM-^@M-^\gangliomimeticM-bM-^@M-^] therapies that can be administered peripherally is highly desirable and would greatly accelerate the development of a therapy for HD. As a first step towards the identification or design of gangliomimetic compounds with improved pharmacokinetic profile, we have screened natural gangliosides and strategically designed gangliomimetic compounds to identify the key chemical structure/s required to recapitulate the neuroprotective effects of GM1 in models of HD.  Using an in vitro assay to measure cell apoptosis, we have identified compounds with similar or increased potency with respect to GM1. In preliminary studies, one of these compounds provided therapeutic benefits in an HD mouse model after intraperitoneal injection for 28 days.  Overall, my thesis shows that the therapeutic effects of GM1 extend beyond amelioration of motor symptoms and support the hypothesis that GM1 has disease-modifying properties in HD models. Furthermore, my thesis supports the idea that second generation compounds can be developed with improved administration profiles while maintaining similar efficacy." ;

    ns5:abstract "Have Canadian citizenship discourses and practices fundamentally changed after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001?  This is the question driving this study.  While dominant accounts suggest that 9/11 was wholly transformative, there is no clear consensus both in and outside the academy as to whether we can characterize 9/11 as a fundamental rupture in time.  Moreover, amongst those who do posit this moment in time as causally transformative, there is no firm consensus as to the nature of that transformation.    To answer the question, this dissertation draws on print media accounts as well as Canadian Federal Court, Federal Court of Appeal, and Supreme Court of Canada decisions between 1980 and 2010.   These are used to track three key areas in which the assumptions around governing and citizenship were subject to intense contestation in the post-9/11 context: 1) discourses of multiculturalism, the issue of reasonable accommodation, and the anxiety over the veiling practices of some Muslim women; 2) discourses of civil liberties and the suppression of academic freedom in the context of organizing for Palestinian rights at Canadian universities, and; 3) discourses of security and CanadaM-bM-^@M-^Ys controversial security certificate program. By identifying parallels and continuities across the pre- and post-9/11 periods, this project challenges the dominant understanding that 9/11 constitutes a fundamental shift in politics.  I argue that empirically, the historical lineage of each case study demonstrates that the intense forms of regulation non-normative, marginalized and dissident citizens are subject to in the post-9/11 period are not unique to this period.  Put differently, these forms of regulation were not made possible by the terrorist attacks of 9/11, the 9/11 moment does not fully give us the tools to make sense of these cases, and the case studies are literal reiterations of discursive and regulatory moments that significantly predate this moment in time.  Second, I argue that in the Canadian context, liberal theories of differentiated citizenship do not help us analytically understand this continuity, and instead suggest that the 9/11 attacks interrupted a presumed trajectory of liberal progression.     The studyM-bM-^@M-^Ys findings have broader theoretical implications for citizenship and change.  In Canadian Political Science, liberal theories of differentiated citizenship have dominated academic accounts.  By and large, these approaches understand citizenship as a status, an institution or an assemblage of rights and responsibilities.  Drawing on the work of David Theo Goldberg, Giorgio Agamben, Holloway Sparks and Rita Dhamoon, this dissertation treats citizenship as a form of regulation, and demonstrates how processes of racialization, securitization and ideas of M-bM-^@M-^XdissidenceM-bM-^@M-^Y are integral to how we are governed as citizens.  By focusing on these processes, this research offers an alternative understanding of citizenship that accounts for the experiences of marginalized groups, and in doing so exposes how accounts of time, crisis and change are deeply political.  Moreover, the account offered here disrupts the presumption that 9/11 interrupted a history of uncomplicated liberal progress.  This has several consequences for how Canadian political scientists theorize citizenship including: re-evaluating the conventional M-bM-^@M-^XcuesM-bM-^@M-^Y or signals used to measure or assess citizenship and progress; accounting for the differential nature of citizenship regulation; complicating how we theorize the relationship between citizens and non-citizens; taking account of the transnational nature of the regulation of citizenship; and, ultimately, reconsidering the value of frameworks of belonging in analyzing citizenship." ;

    ns5:abstract "Neurotrophic factor peptide analogues are capable of promoting healing by neurogenesis, enhancing neuronal survival and attenuating glial activation. In vivo peptide delivery is difficult due to susceptibility to proteases, but they are considered ideal therapeutics due to specificity, potency, and size (i.e. diffusion). Self-assembling peptide (RADA)4 is a novel class of peptide that, upon injection, assembles into a 3D nanoscaffold, capable of storing water and molecules. Synthesizing peptide therapeutics onto this nanoscaffold may afford protection from proteases, whilst utilizing resident enzymes (i.e. Matrix Metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2)) for localized, M-bM-^@M-^Xon-demandM-bM-^@M-^Y release. In this thesis, we study the self-assembly of engineered peptides into enzymatically sensitive nanoscaffolds for proteolytic induced release kinetics, gial activity, and PC-12 neurite-outgrowth. Specifically, peptides with high ((RADA)4-GG-GPQG+IASQ (CP1)) and low ((RADA)4-GG-GPQG+PAGQ (CP2)) MMP-2 sensitivity were investigated ('+' = scissile bond). These peptides were shown to self-assemble, measured incrementally by morphology, over 24 hours and CP1 and CP2 favored bundles of nanofibers when compared to (RADA)4 morphology. Fractal dimensions in these nanostructures were significant after 2 hours, suggesting diffusion limitations of fractal nanofibers. Methionine-Valine-Guanine (MVG; DP1), a brain-derived neurotrophic factor secretion stimulant, and Aspartic acid-Guanine-Guanine-Leucine (DGGL; DP2), a cilliary neurotrophic factor analogue, were tethered to CP1 and CP2, by automated peptide synthesis, and mixed with (RADA)4-IKVAV as a means of promoting cell adherence. Nanoscaffold self-assembly, enzyme-induced release of DP1 and DP2, glial activation and resulting PC-12 acetylcholine-esterase signaling and neurite outgrowth were evaluated. Release kinetics were shown to be related to the high (CP1) and low (CP2) activity cut sites and by their concentrations. Peptide release could be controlled between 0 and 100%, iii over 32 days, depending on nanoscaffold design. Nanoscaffold seeded microglia were visually ramified and MTT levels were found to be highest in pure (RADA)4 nanoscaffolds; suggesting increased adhesion and survival. Ramified microglia, as well as negligible astrocyte scarring and axonal cell death were also observed upon an intra-cerebral injection into the brains of 2-day post-natal rat pups. MMP-2 released peptide-drugs promoted differentiation in PC-12 cells; observed neurite extension and increased acetylcholine esterase signaling for nanoscaffolds composed of 10% v/v (RADA)4-IKVAV, 10% v/v (RADA)4-CP1/CP2-MVG/DGGL, and 80% (RADA)4. Finally, optimal seeding capacity was observed upon addition of 10% v/v (RADA)4-IKVAV to the nanoscaffolds. (RADA)4 nanoscaffolds were observed to self-assemble, exhibit microglia compatibility without affecting their response to lipopolysaccaride stimulation, and able to promote neural differentiation for PC-12 cells upon release of DP1 or DP2. Thus a biomimetic, fully synthetic self-assembling nanoscaffold has been demonstrated for a tuneable drug release system with good microglia and intra-cerebral biocompatibility capable of inducing neural differentiation by peptide cleavage." ;

    ns5:abstract "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease of the central nervous system characterized by neurodegeneration, inflammation and demyelination. Symptoms of multiple sclerosis not only include motor deficits, but also secondary symptoms of pain, depression and anxiety. The purpose of this thesis was firstly to understand the underlying mechanism of these symptoms and secondly to investigate possible treatments. The first half of this thesis investigates the role of several key neurotransmitter systems in the progression and symptomatology of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model for MS. The second half of this thesis examines whether exercise can modify the non-motor symptoms associated with EAE. Experiments in chapter 2 examined the effect of phenelzine (PLZ) in EAE. Daily PLZ treatment, starting seven days after disease induction, delayed EAE onset, reduced disease severity in the chronic phase and was associated with improvements in exploratory behaviour and a novel measure of sickness behaviour. EAE mice treated with daily PLZ showed a recovery in the levels of serotonin (5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE). In particular, EAE mice treated with PLZ showed a normalization of 5-HT levels in the ventral horn of the spinal cord. However, no differences were observed in the amount of T cell infiltration, microglia/macrophage reactivity, demyelination or axonal injury in PLZ-treated spinal cords.  In chapter 3, we conducted experiments in which PLZ treatment only began when mice with EAE exhibited the first clinical signs of the disease, to determine whether PLZ could have beneficial effects in an already established disease state. Using this more clinically relevant treatment approach, we found that PLZ treatment reduced the severity of clinical signs and improved exploratory behaviours for the duration of the experiment in mice with EAE. These improvements were associated with higher levels of M-NM-3-aminobutyric acid (GABA), 5-HT, dopamine (DA) and NE in the brain and spinal cord.  In chapter 4, work was undertaken to assess whether exercise could improve both the motor deficits and secondary symptoms of EAE. Allowing EAE mice 1 hour every day of voluntary running led to a significant delay in the onset of disease symptoms. The development of mechanical allodynia was assessed using Von Frey hairs and indicated that wheel running had a modest positive effect on the pain hypersensitivity associated with EAE. These behavioural changes were associated with decreased CNS inflammation, reduced oxidative stress and less mitochondrial protein expression.  Unlike the case in chapters 2 and 3, voluntary wheel running led to only minor changes in neurotransmitter levels. The work done in chapter 5 further investigates the mitochondrial changes that occur during early EAE by examining the proteins involved in mitochondrial fission, fusion and biogenesis.  EAE animals had increased levels of both the outer mitochondrial membrane protein Tom20 and the complex IV protein (COX IV) within the dorsal horn of the spinal cord compared to control mice. This increase was associated with an increase in the mitochondrial fission mediator, Drp1, a decrease in phosphorylated Drp1 at ser616, a decrease the fusion protein mitofusin 2 (MFN2), and a decrease in the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1alpha (PGC-1M-NM-1). The work in this thesis demonstrated the therapeutic potential of the monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor PLZ and of daily exercise in MS. This study led to the identification of the role of several key neurotransmitters and also highlights mitochondrial dysfunction in the secondary symptoms of the disease. Further research into these mechanisms may lead to the development of novel therapies for MS." ;

    ns3:abstract "Merlin is a tumour suppressor protein, the loss of which is linked to the inherited nervous system tumour syndrome Neurofibromatosis type 2 as well as sporadic tumour development. It is related to the ERM (ezrin-radixin-moesin) protein family, which is involved in linking the cytoskeleton to membrane associated proteins and thereby coordinating processes such as cell shape and polarity. However, MerlinM-bM-^@M-^Ys activity as a tumour suppressor is not clearly defined, nor is it clear why tumours form primarily in the nervous system although Merlin is broadly expressed. Merlin has numerous interacting partners, and a possible explanation for nervous system specific tumour development is that one or more Merlin interacting proteins modifies its tumour suppressor activity in these cell types. In Drosophila melanogaster, a non-canonical translation initiation factor eIF4E 3 was previously identified as genetically interacting with Merlin. In this study, the interaction between Merlin and eIF4E 3 was further characterised in the nervous system and male germline of Drosophila as eIF4E 3 expression appears to be restricted to these tissues. Thus, eIF4E 3 may be a candidate for cell type specific modification of Merlin activity. Merlin and eIF4E 3 genetically interact to affect the abundance of neuroblasts in the larval central brain, morphology of the mature testis, and subcellular localisation of eIF4E 3 and Merlin in spermatocytes. Preliminary evidence indicates that Merlin and eIF4E 3 may be able to both increase and decrease translation of transcripts identified as bound to both proteins in vivo, suggesting multiple translational regulatory complexes including Merlin and eIF4E 3 may be formed." ;

Besides, non-isotropic orientation or percolation of rod-shaped CNC suspension results in self-assembly, elasticity, thixotropy and birefringence at low concentration. With the presence of electrolytes, polymer solutions, micelles, foams and other particles, the degree of ordering of CNCs can be controlled in mesoscopic level, leading to certain macroscopic properties useful for a wide range of products. Therefore, in this research, interactions between CNCs particles with neutral and anionic polymer chains in aqueous solutions were investigated in terms of rheological measurements, structure formation, stability of particles, and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) measurements. Regarding rheological measurements, studies were conducted on the steady-state shear flow and linear viscoelastic properties of CNC suspensions with/without carboxylmethyl cellulose (CMC) and polyethylene oxide (PEO). An addition of a low amount of CNC concentration in water does not generate significant changes in the steady shear viscosity. This behavior is reasonable because dilute and semi-dilute CNC suspensions were in the isotropic state. By contrast, adding both dilute (0.5%) and semi-dilute entangled (1.00%, 2.00% and 3.00%) CMC solutions in CNC suspensions, within the concentration range of 0.33-2.00 vol%, increased the viscosity drastically. When linear viscoelastic properties was measured, it was found that the structure formation in CNC-CMC mixtures led to GM-bM-^@M-^Y >GM-bM-^@M-^YM-bM-^@M-^Y and gel-like behavior. Adding polyethylene oxide (PEO) in CNC suspensions showed an unexpected shear viscosity trend than CMC solutions and didnM-bM-^@M-^Yt cause any significant change in the steady-shear viscosity and viscoelasticity. Therefore, the presence of anionic CMC and non-ionic PEO in CNC suspensions led to different phase behaviors due to different interaction mechanisms. The structure formation was investigated with the use of a Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) and a Polarized Optical Microscopy (POM). Ordered CNC structures, as nematic flocs, were observed in STEM images of dilute CMC-CNC solutions. POM images of CNC-CMC solutions showed phase transitions from the isotropic state to nematic and chiral nematic phases, indicating depletion interactions. In the case of dilute PEO-CNC solutions, there were no specific alignments of CNC particles in PEO matrix. However, birefringence structures, which are a sign of the nematic order of CNC particles, were observed in the case of 2.00 vol% CNC suspensions in 5.0 wt% PEO solutions. Stability of particles was studied in terms of dynamic light scattering and zeta potential measurements. The diffusion coefficient of CNC decreased in the presence of CMC chains since the depletion flocculation was more probable. Moreover, the values of electrophoretic mobility didnM-bM-^@M-^Yt change in the presence of CMC chains. The adsorption of PEO chains onto the surface of CNCs increased the zeta potential values from -56 mV to the range between -29 and -22 mV.  1H spin-lattice relaxation NMR data direct techniques for understanding interactions of CMC and PEO chains with CNC particles. The minima of the specific relaxation rate, (R2), constants with respect polymer concentration showed depleted CNC nanoparticles in CMC and PEO solutions. In the case of CNC-PEO solutions, obtaining two different spin-spin relaxation time (T2) values indicates the adsorption of PEO chains onto CNC.  Consequently, the depletion flocculation was the main interaction mechanism between CMC chains and CNC particles in an aqueous medium. This mechanism created nematic flocs of CNC particles. The presence of blob structures from nematic flocs in CNC-CMC solutions resulted in a dramatic increase in the steady-steady viscosity and gel-like behavior. The PEO adsorption onto CNC surfaces weakened depletion interactions so viscosity and viscoelasticity of CNC suspensions didnM-bM-^@M-^Yt change significantly in the presence of PEO chains. This study explained that the different interaction mechanisms between polymers and CNC nanoparticles can generate different structure and rheological behaviours." ;

    ns2:abstract "Written by Mary Evelyn and published posthumously by her father John Evelyn, the Mundus Muliebris, or The Ladies Dressing-Room UnlockM-bM-^@M-^Yd (1690) consists of three parts: a preface written by John Evelyn, a poem M-bM-^@M-^\A Voyage to Marryland; or, the Ladies Dressing-Room,M-bM-^@M-^] and a word list, M-bM-^@M-^\The Fop-Dictionary: or, an Alphabetical Catalogue of the Hard and Foreign Names, and Terms of the Art Cosmetic.M-bM-^@M-^] Recent criticism has glossed the Mundus Muliebris (Phillipy, 2006; Chico 2005). ChicoM-bM-^@M-^Ys study in particular finds the poem M-bM-^@M-^\limited to particularitiesM-bM-^@M-^]; moreover, she concludes, M-bM-^@M-^\[t]here is no narrativeM-bM-^@M-&or a change of topicM-bM-^@M-^] (105). The Mundus Muliebris is indeed a book abounding in material particularities and moments of narrative fallibility; however, what seems to be a fatal limitation is, in fact, the chief strength of the text. This dissertation will argue that the poem and dictionary were written by Mary Evelyn, with the addition of some recognizable passages by John Evelyn. It will also seek to show that there is a discernable narrative structure in the Mundus Muliebris featuring subtle but crucial changes in topic, tone, voice, mood, and other figures, both rhetorical (plot) and poetic (structure). These set it apart from dressing-room satires M-bM-^@M-^T PopeM-bM-^@M-^Ys The Rape of the Lock (1712); SwiftM-bM-^@M-^Ys The LadyM-bM-^@M-^Ys Dressing-Room (1732) M-bM-^@M-^T and suggest its resonances with other generic modes including the didacticism of the conduct manual and the female agency of the conte de fM-CM-)es. By examining the bookM-bM-^@M-^Ys content through a close reading and book history approaches, situating the text within MartzM-bM-^@M-^Ys structure of metaphysical poetry and narrative theoryM-bM-^@M-^Ys discussion of time and space, and attending to its context via new historicist and cultural materialist techniques as well as structuralist approaches, we will see that the Mundus Muliebris is productive of a range of topics relating to the narrative and the larger fields of poetics, economics, and science." ;

    ns1:abstract "The first chapter of this thesis describes the studies towards conversion of cycloalk-2-enones into 2-methylcyclo-alkane-1,3-diones.  The key step is a TamaoM-bM-^@M-^SFleming oxidation where a silyl group serves as a masked hydroxy group.  Examination of various Tamao-Fleming procedures are discussed.  In particular, mechanistic insight into the use of the Me3SiMe2Si unit is revealed.  The second chapter describes studies aimed at the synthesis of meta-substituted phenols via transition metal-free aromatization.  Based on the previous work from this laboratory, a general route to 3,5-disubstituted and polysubstituted phenols has been developed.  Each of the substituents in the final aromatic product is installed in a completely region-controlled manner and each can have a wide range of values.  A demonstration of this method in the synthesis of pharmaceutically important intermediates is described as well.  Further application of this methodology towards the total synthesis of Fulvestrant (a breast cancer drug) is currently under investigation." ;

    ns2:abstract "The analysis of thousands of metabolites and lipids for discovery of metabolite biomarkers for disease monitoring and diagnosis requires the highest sensitivity and robust methods. Metabolomics is the study of metabolites found in the body, which can be used to discover biomarkers of disease or monitor interactions in our body. In my thesis, I developed liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) methods that analyze small volumes of samples for metabolomics and profile the changes in lipids in serum samples collected from ParkinsonM-bM-^@M-^Ys disease (PD) patients and healthy controls to find PD biomarkers. Separation techniques have improved the field of metabolomics and lipidomics by increasing sensitivity, throughput, and resolution. In particular, the use of nanoliter flow liquid chromatography (nLC) and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) have shown great promise. nLC takes the regular flow of the LC and reduces it to micro- or nano liter flow. With the decreased flow, the column size and connections need to be reduced as well. The advancements of these technologies have increased the coverage of the metabolome and lipidome. I used nLC-MS to improve the overall analytical performance of metabolomic profiling for handling of samples with small volumes. I first optimized nLC-MS for high performance chemical isotope labeling (CIL) metabolomics. CIL is a method used to chemically label metabolites to increase their retention on reversed phase (RP) separation, to improve ionization efficiency, and to allow for relative quantification. CIL is a sensitive technique, although when sample volumes are limited or the concentration of samples is low, the use of nLC is needed. nLC is used to increase coverage of the CIL metabolome and reduce sample consumption through the use of analyte trapping. iii Recent advancements in mass spectrometry, specifically in quadrupole time-of-flight (QTOF) instruments, have allowed for higher resolution, faster collection rates and improved sensitivity. This new generation of instrumentation allows us to examine the metabolome and lipidome further. In lipidomics, LC-MS is used to analyze thousands of lipids to get a better understanding of the lipidome and their roles in diseases. We used an ultra-high resolution quadrupole time of flight (UHR-QTOF) instrument connected to UHPLC to profile PD samples to identify potential biomarkers. Ultra-high resolution allows for higher mass precision and increased confidence in identification. Using statistical analyses we determined five lipids to distinguish the diseased samples from the controls. In receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, these potential biomarkers had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.976 with sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 90%. The same panel of five lipids plus another compound were used to distinguish PDD from PD. ROC analysis of the 6 compounds gave an AUC of 0.958 with sensitivity of 87% and specificity of 94%. We also observed an increasing trend of the 5 common lipids in concentration, suggesting the potential of using these biomarkers for not only diagnosis of PD, but also tracking PD progression into PDD." ;

    ns3:abstract "NaChBac is a voltage-gated Na+ channel from the bacterium Bacillus haloduran. Studying this protein channel can help researchers discover potential pharmaceuticals, innovative strategies in eliminating biofilms, and could be used to improve desalinization technologies. This thesis will discuss the charaterization of NaChBac in artifical lipid membrane, including single molecule study on the conductance and ion selectivity using a planar bilayer membrane device and the development of a scattered light based stopped-flow flux assay.  Planar lipid bilayer membrane is a common technique to characterize ion channel function. In this thesis, purified NaChBac protein was incorporated into lipid vesicles which were then fused to a planar lipid bilayer. By applying a controllable electrical potential (i.e. voltage) across the protein-embedded bilayer and measuring the resulting current, the conductance, gating behaviour, and ion selectivity of the open channel were studied. NaChBac was found to have three conductance levels at 268.5 M-BM-1 45.2 pS (mean M-BM-1 SEM, n=2), 92.8 M-BM-1 18.0 pS (n=3), and 26.4 M-BM-1 5.6 pS (n=4), respectively. Its activation gating voltage (V1/2) is -28 mV and its apparent activation gating charge is 15.9 elementary charge. NaChBac tested under asymmetric saline buffer solution conditions was shown to have a relative permeability PNa+/PK+ ranging from 0.86 to 1.35 and PNa+/PCa2+ = 1.43 M-BM-1 0.20 (n=3, M-BM-1SEM).  Conventional flux assay for ion channels requires the use of ion-specific dyes. However, the availability of the dyes and their selectivity limits the spectrum of ion channels that can be tested in a fluorescence flux assay. Instead, stopped-flow spectrometry can be used to monitor the change in size of the protein-incorporating vesicles that is caused by ion flux, which is in turn triggered by the transmembrane electrochemical gradient of the target ion species. With this method, the ion conducting function of purified NaChBac protein was shown. The method can potentially be used to test the functionality of other ion channels." ;

    ns5:abstract "Depression is a common, recurrent and frequently chronic mental health disorder that has already become one of the leading health-care burdens. Despite the wide clinical application of antidepressants, a significant portion of patients does not benefit sufficiently from the standard medication therapies. Therefore, developing alternative safe and effective treatment options is required. Over the years, studies have shown that transcranial ultrasound has the ability to noninvasively and remotely modulate neurons and neural network activity. However, the prospect of using ultrasound as a treatment for depression still needs to be elucidated. The current study investigated the potential application of low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS), a specific type of ultrasound, as a therapeutic option for depression. It was found that LIPUS stimulation significantly increased the viability of both neuron-like SH-SY5Y cells and primary glia cells in vitro. Further protein analysis revealed that LIPUS promoted the phosphorylation of M-NM-2-catenin in primary glia cells and increased the level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in both cell types. Animal studies using the repetitive restraint stress (RRS) model showed that LIPUS administration significantly alleviated the depression-like behaviors of mice in the sucrose preference test (SPT), tail suspension test (TST), forced swimming test (FST) and Y-maze test (YMT). Further testing indicated potential mechanisms for the beneficial effects of LIPUS on depression are associated with the promotion of neurogenesis and elevation of BDNF levels, which were consistent with the results of the in vitro study. The cuprizone (CPZ) induced demyelination animal model was used to determine the role of myelin and oligodendrocytes (OLs) both in pathogenesis and as therapeutic targets. It was found that LIPUS did not significantly attenuate the depressive-like behaviors in the TST, FST, and YMT in mice exposed to CPZ, although additional testing revealed that LIPUS alleviated CPZ-induced damage to both mature myelin and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). Taken together, the findings from the in vitro and in vivo studies indicate that LIPUS has potential as a promising therapeutic option for depression, not only by promoting neurogenesis and elevating BDNF levels, but also through protection and promotion of myelin and OLs. In addition to offering a new possible treatment for depression, this study also highlights the importance of neurogenesis and neurotrophy and the role of myelin and OLs in the pathogenesis of depression." ;

    ns4:abstract "Metallocarbenes are a class of reactive intermediates used in many strategic and complementary carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom bond forming reactions. The Stevens [1,2]-rearrangement of ammonium ylides is an example of a transformation typically involving metallocarbenes. The replacement of the amine with azide in this metallocarbene-mediated process results to the formation of an electron-deficient imine; this imine can then be trapped with variety of nucleophiles. During the course of our study using electron-rich arenes as nucleophilic traps, a key step in the proposed total synthesis of isatisine A, we began to have issues with regioselectivity. In an effort to trouble-shoot this process, we encountered some seemingly anomalous results. Highly inquisitive, mechanistic studies were then undertaken to understand the progress of the reaction. These mechanistic studies resulted in the elucidation of a novel dual catalysis mechanism for this domino process. A library of compounds (truncated analogs of isatisine A) was then made using the newly developed reaction conditions. The mechanism was then used as a guide to develop asymmetric versions of the transformation. While attempting to apply the newly developed reaction transformation to the synthesis of isatisine A, another opportunity arose. We began exploring the possibility of expanding the existing chemical library through umpolung (reversal of polarity) reactivity. Although we were unable to induce umpulong reactivity of nucleophiles with our rigid electrophilic C-acylimines, a different regiodivergent functionalization was developed, opening the door to a greater variety of compounds. This library of new compounds was then submitted to be screened for potential antiviral activity. After several rounds of structure activity relationship studies, new lead structures were found. This dissertation has many important implications: (1) the potential of the western fragment of isatisine A as a novel antiviral lead, (2) a novel dual catalysis in metallocarbene chemistry utilizing the concept of electrophilic metalation." ;

    ns6:abstract "Nanomaterials are important building blocks of nanotechnology. Their size dependent unique properties (optical, magnetic, electrical, etc.) have the potential to revolutionize applications ranging from medicine to electronics. Of the various nanomaterials, carbon-based systems including porous carbon, graphene, graphite nanofibers, and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have received considerable attention due to their high surface area, limited toxicity, biocompatibility, electronic conductivity, chemical stability, and low density. Despite the development of different synthetic approaches for preparing various carbons, there is still vast interest in developing cost-effective scalable methods for the synthesis of carbon-based materials, in particular mesoporous carbons. Owing to their high surface area, carbon based materials have been extensively studied for catalytic applications. However, important challenges related to material synthesis remain. The research described in this dissertation attempts to address challenges associated with synthesis of mesoporous carbons as well as their prototype catalytic applications. The investigations then shift to the synthesis and applications of iron oxide nanorods coated with N-doped mesoporous carbon core-shell nanostructures as catalyst. Finally, the extension of photothermally responsive hybrid gold/silica nanoparticles into catalytic applications is explored.   The thesis starts with an introduction summarizing the broad field of nanomaterials. Focus then shifts to the materials (i.e., mesoporous carbon, iron oxide nanoparticles and gold nanoparticles) specific to the presented investigation.  Chapter Two outlines on synthesis of hollow mesoporous carbon (HMC) nanostructures using dopamine as carbon precursor. The HMC was fully characterized. The resulting HMC was employed as an electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction/evolution reactions (ORR/OER) in zinc air battery (ZAB). The HMCs exhibited outstanding ORR onset potential and excellent stability comparable to that of precious metal catalyst. Chapter Three presents the synthesis of high surface area hollow carbon spheres (HCS) using crystalline nanocellulose (CNC) as carbon precursor and a detailed investigation and discussion on the formation mechanism. The synthesized HCS were implemented for catalytic conversion of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) to 4-aminophenol (4-AP). The catalytic activity was investigated in terms reaction rate and activity parameter. The HCS exhibited remarkable catalytic activity comparable to that of their metallic nanoparticles counterparts.  Chapter Four is extension of previous work where mesoporous carbon is used as a thin shell material. The synthesis of Fe3O4 nanorods coated with a nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon shell (ND-Fe3O4@mC) via a new microwave-assisted approach is presented. The electrochemical performances of ND-Fe3O4@mC with different carbon shell thicknesses are evaluated. The results reveal enhanced ORR catalytic activity for the catalyst with thinnest carbon shell. The synthesis of different morphologies of gold nanostructures along with hybrid gold/silica nanoparticles is presented in Chapter Five. The optical properties of these structures are investigated in detail and co-related with structure. The application of silica decorated with gold nanoparticles investigated for catalytic conversion of 4-NP conversion to 4-AP.  Finally, Chapter Six provides a summary of the conclusions of the work and outlines future work." ;

    ns3:abstract "This thesis reports the separation behavior of SDS-protein complexes in colloidal self-assembled (CSA) nanoparticle beds, and the processes of stabilization of CSA beds for high voltage separation. First, the variation of electrophoretic mobility with molecular weight (6.5-66 kDa) of SDS-protein complexes and with particle size (150-690 nm) was evaluated using a classical, modified Ogston sieving model for protein separation for a random pore gel structure, and using the modified Giddings analysis developed by Wirth for uniform pores structure.  The results show improved fits (R2 = 0.993-0.997) and better predictive interpolations of the molecular weight on unknowns using the Wirth/Giddings model for a uniform pore structure. The quality of fit of the single pore size model indicates that it is meaningful to characterize these structures as having a predominantly single pore size. A CSA bed of native silica nanoparticles is not stable for high voltage application. Two different approaches have been demonstrated to stabilize the CSA beds in this work. By reducing the depth of the CSA beds by half or more, three to four times the electric field stability (from M-bM-^IM-$ 320 V/cm for 20 M-BM-5m thick bed to  M-LM-4 2250 V/cm for 4 M-BM-5m thick bed) is achieved. Narrowing the capillary bore greatly stabilized the particle beds, even for smaller particle assemblies. The improved separation performance of narrow bore capillaries increases the particle bed performance in protein separation. But unfortunately the narrow bore chips are still not stable for long term repetitive use. These kind of chips are suitable for up to 5-6 runs at highest stable voltage. Base catalyzed sol-gel polymerization introduces cross links between the particles to entrap them, and solves the problem. But the acid catalyzed gel filled the pores and made the microchip unusable. The CSA bed entrapped by gel can be used for at least a week (10-15 runs /day) and the reproducibility of fabrication is high (yield = 90%). This study demonstrates that gel entrapped particles bed can be used for high performance SDS-protein separation up to several days without significant deviation of chip performance. The results demonstrate that this simple and inexpensive fabrication process for microchips with a CSA bed has high potential in improving protein analysis, compared to competing technologies such as conventional gels." ;

    ns4:abstract "Ducks are the natural reservoir of influenza A virus. Normally, the virus replicates in their intestine and is passed in the feces, although highly pathogenic influenza A virus replicates in the lungs. Influenza infection in ducks is frequently asymptomatic. During infection with highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1, viperin (virus-induced protein endoplasmic reticulum-associated interferon-inducible) was the most up-regulated innate immune gene in the duck lungs but was not upregulated in the duck intestine. Here we determined the effect of duck viperin on influenza A virus during infection. Chicken fibroblast cells stably expressing duck viperin or vector only were infected with low pathogenic influenza A virus A/chicken/CA/431/2000. Viperin decreased the viral titre after 24, 48 and 72 hours of infection. Viperin was suspected to decrease the lipid rafts through interacting with farnesyl diphosphate synthase. Using confocal microscopy and flow cytometry, we showed that duck viperin expression decreased the lipid rafts in the chicken fibroblast cells. The addition of exogenous farnesol, which works downstream of farnesyl diphosphate synthase, reversed the antiviral effect of duck viperin. Finally, we identified the critical regions and residues important for function of duck viperin. The central domain contains radical S-Adenosyl methionine motifs, mutation of which leads to loss of viperin antiviral effect. Viperin, which is induced by highly pathogenic influenza A virus, has an antiviral function." ;

In studying the electronic nature of SiNCs, the functionalization of SiNCs with electroactive end groups is of interest. Successful functionalization of silicon nanocrystals with an electroactive ligand, ferrocene, was achieved and the resulting material was fully characterized. Electronic interaction between the SiNC and ferrocene occurs via an electron transfer mechanism.  This is the first example of freestanding SiNCs functionalized with ferrocene.   Photostability of SiNC photoluminescence (PL) is a limitation in the development of efficient devices and bioimaging applications. The photostability of SiNCs with a series of surface ligands was studied due to strong influence of surface chemistry on SiNC optoelectronic properties. Investigation of a series of surface functionalized SiNCs under photobleaching condition revealed that the effect of oxygen has a greater influence on PL stability than the surface group functionalized." ;

    ns2:abstract "The purpose of this thesis is to examine literary use of music in a large selection of the writings of Andre Gide and Aldous Huxley. The introduction exposes the various problems involved in any study of the integration of music into literature, and uncovers the reasons for my special interest in the function of music in the work of the two writers. The first chapter proves that Gide and Huxley were competent musicians and critics of music and that, therefore, their literary allusions to music are backed by professional understanding of music. The second chapter studies the use of references to music as themes and symbols in selected writings of Gide before Les.Faux-Monnayeurs and of Huxley before Point Counter Point. The third chapter demonstrates how even in their early writings Gide and Huxley employ certain literary techniques which are reused in Les Faux-Monnayeurs and Point Counter Point to suggest musical structures within novelistic form. The fourth chapter studies the musical structures of these two novels.It shows how Gide and Huxley coordinate musical form with the \"meaning\" of the two novels. The fifth chapter considers whether Huxley's literary experimentation with music may have been influenced by Gide's. The conclusion comments on the relative success of their experimentation, and looks briefly at the role of music in the writings of Gide after Les Faux-Monnayeurs and of Huxley after Point Counter Point." ;

        "Surface Passivation" ;
    ns3:abstract "Silicon nanocrystals (SiNCs) have been explored as active materials in a variety of prototype applications including photovoltaics, electronics, photonics, and sensors based on their optical and electronic properties.  Using SiNCs are appealing because their source material (i.e., silicon) is abundant, they exhibit limited toxicity, and their optical as well as electronic properties are tunable.  To further the advancement of SiNC-based applications, there is a need to develop surface functionalization methods that provide stability and render the SiNCs solution-processable.  This must be achieved while maintaining, and even tailoring SiNC optical response.  This thesis consists of two overarching themes: the surface passivation of SiNCs (Chapters 2-3) and the development of SiNC-based sensors (Chapters 4-5).  Chapter 2 investigates the hydrosilylation of SiNCs with a variety of alkenes and alkynes using two common radical initiators (i.e., azobisisobutyronitrile and benzoyl peroxide).  Chapter 3 examines the use of a compact fluorescent light source for the generation of thiyl radicals from two disulfide containing ligands (i.e., lipoic acid and dibutyl disulfide) to promote radical initiation of the SiNC surface to generate Si-S surface bonds.  Chapter 4 describes the development of a luminescent paper-based sensor using dodecyl functionalized SiNCs for its optical response towards nitro-group containing high energy compounds (i.e., trinitrotoluene (TNT), cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (RDX) and pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN)).  Ester functionalized SiNCs were embedded into polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) based-substrates for the optical detection of biogenic amine vapors released during food spoilage in Chapter 5.    Finally, in Chapter 6, a summary of the findings of SiNC surface passivation and sensors is presented, followed by possible future research directions in these areas." ;

    ns4:subject "Second Harmonic Generation",
        "Silica/Water",
        "Sum Frequency Generation" ;
    ns3:abstract "The silica/water interface is complex and depends on a multitude of properties like surface charge, ion concentration, ion identity, and surface structure. Yet because silica is an insulator, the interface it creates with water is often difficult to study. However, the nonlinear optical methods, such as second harmonic generation (SHG) and sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy, are capable of probing the buried interfaces like the silica/water interface.  This thesis focuses on perturbing the silica/water interface through different actions and observing the response of the interfacial species using SHG and SFG.  Firstly, the effect of experimental starting pH on the acid-base titration curves at the silica/water interface using SHG was explored.  Depending on the starting pH, either two or three pKa sites were observed as the pH was varied.  Vibrational SFG was then used to monitor the response of water molecules to changes in NaCl concentration and experimental starting pH.  At high ionic strength, the pH dependent SFG of NaCl was different than that observed by SHG, indicating that they probed different aspects of the interface.  Additionally, the experimental starting pH had little effect on the resultant SFG signal in contrast with the SHG results, which did depend on the experimental starting pH. This difference provided further support that SHG and ssp polarized SFG are sensitive to different features of the interface. We observed that the minimum intensity of the ssp polarized SFG depended on the salt concentration; specifically it shifted from ~ pH 6 to pH 8 upon increasing the salt from 0.1 M to 0.5 M.  In contrast, the SHG minimum was always at pH 2 independent of salt concentration. The peak observed at 3200 cm-1 that dominates the ssp polarized SFG has been proposed to be sensitive to water molecules farther from the surface. Consequently we theorized that this minimum in SFG intensity corresponded to a minimum in the zeta potential, which has been shown to shift to higher pH with higher salt concentration. Next, the same polarization combinations of light were utilized in both SHG and SFG to do a direct comparison of the two techniques. Unlike the ssp SFG pH dependence, the pss polarized SFG pH dependence was similar to the pss polarized SHG.  Despite the similarities in trend with pH, we observed that the magnitude of the intensity changes of the SHG signal could not be fully explained by the change in the intensity of the SFG of water molecules. This led us to conclude that there is another interfacial species that contributes directly to the SHG signal intensity, most likely the siloxides.  Finally, the effect of calcium on both SHG and SFG was explored.  The presence of CaCl2 caused the SHG and both ssp and pss polarized SFG to behave differently compared to each other. Specifically, the SHG signal in the presence of calcium increased in response to increasing pH until a maximum intensity where upon it decreased with further increases in pH.  In contrast SFG exhibited the opposite behavior where the signal intensity in the SFG decreased until a minimum was reached and then increased as the pH was further increased. To understand this unusual pH dependence of the ssp SFG, the SFG range was probed at higher wavenumbers. This expanded range allowed for the observation of a CaOH mode that grew in at high pH that interfered with SFG of the water molecules.  Consequently, we attributed the increase in SFG intensity at higher pH to the appearance of this CaOH species. If these CaOH species were forming right at the surface, then it should disrupt the surface water molecules, which can be visualized using pss polarized SFG. Indeed, the pss polarized SFG decreased with increasing pH suggesting that the formation of CaOH at the interface disrupts the surface water. Moreover, the presence of a new mode in the SFG provides further support that there is another interfacial species that contributes to the SHG intensity, which explains the unusual pH dependence of the latter. Through this work, we have a better understanding of how pH, ion concentration and ion identity affect the silica water interface. These results can be useful for modelling of geochemical phenomena and industrial processing of silica sands/soils." ;

    ns8:subject "bradyrhizose" ;
    ns5:abstract "Bradyrhizose, a bicyclic monosaccharide, was reported in 2011 by Molinaro and coworkers at the University of Naples in Italy. This unusual carbohydrate was isolated from the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Bradyrhizobium sp. BTAi1 and sp. ORS278 as the only component of the O-antigen.  These nitrogen-fixing bacteria live in symbiosis with legumes Aeschynomene sensitiva and indica. It was found that neither the LPS or the pure O-antigen from Bradyrhizobium sp. BTAi1 are recognized by plants as a microbe-associated molecular pattern (MAMP). This is the first example of an LPS not activating a defense response and indicates that the LPS and the O-antigen from these bacteria are non-immunogenic. Synthesizing this molecule, and disaccharides containing it, will provide compounds that can be used to probe the role of this monosaccharide in bacterial symbiosis with the legume.  Two different approaches for the synthesis of bradyrhizose are discussed in this thesis.  For the first route, the monosaccharide was envisioned to be obtained from a furan derivative via the Achmatowicz reaction. For the second route, two different strategies were investigated starting with myo-inositol as the basis of the cyclohexanol moeity of bradyrhizose. The racemic synthesis of bradyrhizose was achieved using the second route. The enantiomers were separated at a late stage of the synthesis to afford D- and L-bradyrhizose.  The synthesis of bradyrhizose donors and acceptors (D- and L-) was accomplished starting with an intermediate used in the synthesis of the monosaccharide. The reactivity of this unusual monosaccharide in glycosylations was studied using a trichloroacetimidate donor and various types of acceptors. Disaccharides containing different enantiomeric forms of the monosaccharide (D,D; L,L; D,L; L,D) were synthesized and will be tested for their ability to induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) in different plants and legumes." ;

    ns5:abstract "One of the most common groups of birth defects are neural tube defects (NTDs), affecting about 1 out of 1000 established pregnancies. NTDs arise during neurulation in vertebrates, preventing proper formation of the brain and/or spina cord. NTDs are characterized by an unfused neural tube, which leads to neurodegeneration due to exposure of neural tissue to the uterine environment. Both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the formation of NTDs. In mice, hundreds of genes have been associated with NTDs. One of these genes is Cecr2, which encodes a protein involved in chromatin remodelling. Mutation to Cecr2 leads to the lethal cranial NTD exencephaly in mice. However, the penetrance of exencephaly in homozygous Cecr2 mutants differs between strains. In BALB/cCrl mice, a homozygous hypomorphic Cecr2 gene-trap mutation causes exencephaly in 54% of embryos while the same mutation on an FVB/N background does not lead to exencephaly. This difference in penetrance is likely due to modifier genes having an effect on the Cecr2 mutant phenotype. Further genetic analyses revealed a major modifier locus on chromosome 19 thought to contain multiple modifiers of Cecr2. In a previous study, coding variants of genes in the modifier region that differed between the two strains of mice were identified along with expression differences. Candidate mouse genes hypothesized to be modifiers of Cecr2 were then sequenced in a cohort of 156 unrelated human cranial NTD fetuses to uncover human variants of the genes that may lead to modification of Cecr2. Human and mouse variants were ranked based on in silico analyses, rarity, and predicted function. One of the top candidates was Dnmbp, a scaffold protein involved in actin and dynamin dynamics as well as CDC42 activation.  In this thesis, I hypothesized that Dnmbp modifies the penetrance of exencephaly in mice through Cecr2. Eight human variants of DNMBP and one mouse variant underwent functional testing for the preservation of protein-protein interactions, CDC42 activation, and cellular localization. Each variant was produced through site-directed mutagenesis and cloned in an expression vector with an N-terminus HA-tag. Variants were transiently transfected into cell lines for analyses. VASP and MENA are two proteins that interact with DNMBP and have been associated with NTDs. I was unable to determine if DNMBP variants maintain their interaction with VASP or MENA due to inconsistency with the co-immunoprecipitation experiment. An assay that measured the number of dense-core vesicles in neuroblastoma cells was conducted to test the level of activated CDC42. Over expression of DNMBP should lead to increased dense-core vesicles due to increased activation of CDC42. However, when the mean fluorescence intensity of a dense-core vesicle marker was measured, there was much variation. Thus, this assay did not provide information on the ability of each variant to activate CDC42.  To determine if there was a genetic interaction between Cdc42 and Cecr2, a mouse model was produced on a FVB/N background containing a heterozygous deletion of Cdc42 and homozygous mutation to Cecr2. Exencephaly was not observed in mice with these two mutations, thus, Dnmbp may not be modifying Cecr2 through Cdc42. Irregularities in localization of DNMBP protein were observed with one of the variants (R1024X) in epithelial cells. Caco-2 cells transfected with R1024X did not show localization of DNMBP to the apical cell membrane, confirming that this variant is damaging and giving evidence that Dnmbp is an NTD modifier gene. While other variants did show localization to the apical membrane of epithelial cells, it is possible that they may not localize correctly to specific regions of other cell types. Thus, it would be worth investigating localization patterns of each variant in other cellular regions DNMBP is known to concentrate. To further associate Dnmbp as a modifier of Cecr2 and a NTD susceptibility gene, the best strategy would be to knockout one allele of Dnmbp in the resistant FVB/N strain of mice with a homozygous Cecr2 mutation. If penetrance of exencephaly increases, it would be well supported that Dnmbp is a modifier of Cecr2. Characterizing the function and localization of Dnmbp variants from susceptible mice and human NTD fetuses could be beneficial in revealing a possible NTD susceptibility gene as well as further elucidating the complexity of neural system development." ;

    ns1:abstract "Worksite safety is a major concern for utility companies maintaining distribution systems. Electric hazards often occur when worksite equipment accidentally contacts a live power line. This leads to dangerous ground potential rise, touch voltage or step voltage in surrounding areas. A number of approaches have been adopted by utility companies to ensure electrical safety on worksites. One of these involves trip grounding. Trip grounding is realized by connecting the equipment with a grounding rod. Once the equipment is energized, a relay at a substation will operate and trip the power supply due to the large fault current. Frequently however, when worksite grounding resistance or system impedance is high, the fault current will be low. This may result in a long fault clearing time or a tripping failure. In order to overcome the above limitations, this study proposes and tests a new approach to actively generate signals with specific patterns from an energized worksite using power electronic devices. Once these specific signals, transmitted through the power line itself, are recognized by a signal detector at the closest upstream recloser, the recloser trips the power supply and protects the worksite safety. The proposed method is first implemented using a diode-based signal generator scheme, which has a simple configuration but restricted application range. Then the approach is further refined using a thyristor-based signal generator scheme to fit a wide range of worksite conditions. As a result, worksite safety can be improved in a short time despite wide system parameter variations, such as high grounding resistance and long feeder distance. Practical considerations for prototype designs and parameter settings of the proposed active protection schemes are presented in this thesis. Simulation studies and sensitivity analysis are conducted to evaluate tripping performance. Comparative studies with conventional relay protection reveal that the proposed schemes offer better response speed and adapt to various worksite conditions." ;

    ns10:abstract "Stuttering is a developmental speech disorder characterized by prolongations and/or repetitions of speech sounds as well as silent blocks during speech production. It affects about 5% of children and 1% of the general population. Growing evidence shows that white matter connections of the brain show deficiencies in people who stutter. Examples of those connections include the arcuate fasciculus, the frontal aslant tract, the corpus callosum and the corticospinal tract. A widely used method to assess the white matter in vivo is diffusion magnetic resonance imaging. Tractography methods based on Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) are able to isolate the white matter connections of the brain. However, DTI has some limitations. For instance, it is based on the assumption that the diffusion pattern follows a Gaussian distribution, while studies have shown that in specific circumstances, e.g. in complex cell compartments, diffusion can deviate from the Gaussian distribution. Kurtosis metrics are able to quantify this deviation and Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging (DKI) gives us the ability to extract the said metrics. Thus, DKI was used in this study to assess the white matter connections of the brain in a group of adults who stutter and a group of age-, sex-, handedness- and education level-matched controls. Using tractography, I delineated the corpus callosum, arcuate fasciculus, frontal aslant tract and corticospinal tract. The results of this study showed that adults who stutter have higher axial kurtosis in the left frontal aslant tract in comparison to controls and to their right frontal aslant tract. Furthermore, radial kurtosis in the right frontal aslant tract of adults who stutter was negatively correlated with the impact of stuttering on their daily lives. Based on these results, it is suggested that the deficits in the frontal aslant tract are associated with the dysfluency encountered in stuttering." ;

    ns7:subject "Neurocysticercosis",
        "Neuroimaging",
        "Seizures" ;
    ns1:abstract "Neurocysticercosis, the major global cause of acquired epilepsy, is a parasitic disease caused by Taenia solium larvae. Patients may have seizures whether larvae in brain are alive or degenerated (calcified). We assessed whether parasitic lesions produce changes in structural brain scans that are associated differentially with the presence of seizures. Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain, including diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), with the metrics of fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (AD or L1), and mean diffusivity (MD) we examined relationships of clinical findings with white matter pathologic features (ischemia, myelination, axonal damage, inflammation, and edema). We also focused on susceptibility weight imaging (SWI). In the first study, we examined DTI results from 51 patients, with (n=38) or without (n=13) seizures in the fifteen days before scanning, under treatment for a single lesion. We measured FA, AD, and MD, over regions of interest (ROIs), defined within the lesion area, and in part of the brain hemisphere (i.e., half brain minus ventricle and infratentorial region), respectively. Metrics of DTI over the ROIs were compared between hemispheres to calculate an index of asymmetry. Patients exhibiting seizures and single lesion had higher brain asymmetry for AD and MD. DTI did not differ between groups, comparing lesion implantation site and the surrounding nervous tissue with the symmetrical contralateral area. These findings support the idea that inflammatory processes related to neurocysticercosis lesions can affect large areas of brain hemispheres, in the context of recent seizures. In the second study, we examined 92 brain lesions in 64 patients under treatment for neurocysticercosis: comprising 71 lesions with seizures and 21 lesions without. With seizures, peak lesion frequencies were observed in precentral gyrus, hippocampus and areas proximal to these structures. Lesions in this group were closer to the brain cortex than non-seizure group lesions. Brain volume affected by the disease was also bigger in the seizure group. Characteristics of lesions included: contours that can be smooth or rough; the presence of parasiteM-bM-^@M-^Ys head; the peri-lesion gradient; the intra-lesion double gradient, and the enhancement of the nourishing vessel (vasa nutricia). Odds of having seizures were higher in the absence of peri-lesion gradient, resembling a shadow between the image of the lesion and the nervous tissue. Finally, sites of lesion implantations follow anatomical patterns of the brain diseases caused by emboli. This innovative finding (related to the deployment of lesions similarly to other emboli) is consistent with the transit paths of larvae from intestine through blood to the brain. These results indicate that in vivo MRI analysis of brain lesions in neurocysticercosis is a useful approach for increasing our understanding of determinants of seizures in this disease. Further examination of lesionM-bM-^@M-^Ssymptom relationships with MRI and using parallel electroencephalographic (EEG) studies may yield clinically useful information about seizures in this patient population that may be identifiable through more widely available EEG technology. Such clinical translational advances would be extremely helpful in attempts to combat and treat this disease in areas where MRI analysis may be neither accessible nor affordable." ;

    ns2:abstract "The Cpx two-component system senses and mediates adaptation to envelope stresses in Escherichia coli. NlpE is an outer membrane lipoprotein that senses surface adhesion and signals the Cpx pathway. This work focused on investigating the molecular mechanisms used by NlpE to signal the Cpx pathway when overexpressed and upon surface adhesion in E. coli. The previously solved crystal structure of NlpE revealed two distinctly formed M-NM-2-barrel domains connected by an unstructured flexible linker. Mutagenesis studies revealed that both the amino- and carboxyl-terminal M-NM-2-barrel domains, as well as the flexible linker contribute to signaling the Cpx pathway. The results suggest a signaling model that involves collaboration between all regions of NlpE. The amino-terminus and the flexible linker also stabilize the lipoprotein for its proper function in E. coli. In vitro pull-down, in vivo co-immunoprecipitation and cross-linking assays were carried out to identify proteins that may interact with NlpE in E. coli. The outer membrane adhesin OmpA was identified.  OmpA is also required for NlpE to sense surface adhesion and convey this signal to the Cpx response. In summary, the findings of this thesis suggest a model in which outer membrane lipoprotein NlpE senses surface adhesion through a direct interaction with the adhesin OmpA and signals the Cpx pathway in a manner that involves all three structural domains of NlpE. The results provide molecular details of the manner in which auxiliary regulator NlpE communicates a signal generated at the outer membrane to a sensory kinase in the inner membrane and may be useful in the future for the design of tools to manipulate bacterial behavior." ;

    ns2:abstract "The work in this thesis describes advancements made towards developing main group catalysts and designing new ligands. N-Heterocyclic imine (NHI) ligands were used to support novel boron, silicon and germanium complexes. The new boron compounds demonstrated the ability to dehydrogenate amine-boranes and instigate their dehydrocoupling. In one case, the catalytic dehydrogenation of amine-boranes was observed. Although the synthesized silicon and germanium compounds were structurally similar, they exhibited very different reactivity under reducing conditions. The former underwent a highly unusual ligand rearrangement, while the latter formed the desired two-coordinate acyclic germylene. In addition, new olefin-based ligands featuring mixed element donors were designed and their coordination chemistry with Lewis acids BH3 and AuCl revealed different binding sites. These findings led to the isolation of a bimetallic complex that employed both donors at the same time. Finally, the preliminary photoluminescent properties of copper and gold complexes supported by the new N-heterocyclic olefin-phosphine (NHOP) ligands will be discussed." ;

    ns3:abstract "Oleaginous seeds, with higher oil and protein content, have higher economic value in the seed oil industry. Meal resulting from the seed oil extraction process is a widely used protein source in animal feed. The reduction of the complex fibre component of seed tissues may direct more carbon into oil and/or protein biosynthesis, thus resulting in seed with higher oil and/or protein content. Since cellulose makes up a large fraction of fibre within seed meal, reducing the levels of this complex carbohydrate may lead to the improved digestibility of the meal. Partial down-regulation of genes catalyzing cellulose synthesis (i.e., AtCESA1 and AtCESA9) using seed-specific intron-spliced hairpin RNA (RNAi) constructs in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) resulted in reductions in the cellulose content of seeds compared to the empty vector control line. Constitutive down-regulation of the AtCESA9 gene also resulted in reduced cellulose content without impacting the vegetative growth of the plant. These results suggest that down-regulation of cellulose synthesis could be a promising strategy for increasing the digestibility of meal derived from oilseed crops such as canola-type Brassica napus. The observed reduction in cellulose content in Arabidopsis, however, did not result in an increase in seed oil content. In contrast, cellulose reduction in AtCESA1 seed-specific RNAi lines resulted in a slight increase in seed protein content. Based on the results presented, it can be concluded that down-regulation of AtCESA genes combined with other metabolic engineering interventions has the potential to result in significantly increased seed oil and/or protein content." ;

    ns4:abstract "BACKGROUND: Limited opportunities for haptic manipulation and motor experience in children with disabilities is linked to developmental delays including cognitive, perceptual, and social impairments. Assistive robots (e.g. Lego robots) have been used as alternative means to remotely act on the environment. Yet, there are critical limitations in provision of direct assisted manipulation. Firstly, typical assistive robot interfaces (e.g. head mounted switches) remotely control the robot in the environment, and thus, fail to simulate the critical aspect of haptic manipulation in transferring the objectsM-bM-^@M-^Y touch-related information. Second, a human helper oftentimes mediates the childM-bM-^@M-^Ys interaction with the environment, obstructing direct interaction with the environment and reducing the childM-bM-^@M-^Ys sense of independence and task control. The functionality of assistive technologies in delivering a haptic-based direct (unmediated human) manipulation experience, particularly in the context of play, has remained unexplored. This suggests the need for research on development of a robotic-based medium capable of simulating direct haptic manipulation and provision of unmediated human assistance. OBJECTIVE: This thesis work is the result of a literature review, a feasibility study and two usability studies in order to address the following objectives: 1) Determine the researched application areas of haptic-based assistive technology for people with disabilities, and determine their implications for children with disabilities. 2) Develop the initial technical requirements for simulation of direct haptic-based manipulation and critically analyze the appropriate choice of candidate robot interfaces for the requirements for the user and task. 3) Identify the technical feasibility to develop and implement a robotic system with virtual (unmediated human) assistance in a manipulative play task. 4) Clinically validate the effectiveness of the developed technology in accommodating manual skills of individuals with disabilities and compare the outcomes of the robot augmented performance with a typical assistive technology computer interface approach.  METHODS: The objectives were addressed as follows: 1) A literature review was undertaken to establish a retrospective insight into research on assistive robotics for people with disabilities with the focus on manual performance. The potential ideas and challenges for implications of the technology for children with disabilities were identified. 2) Simulation of haptic-based direct manipulation was performed through development of a teleoperation system (dual-robot configuration) featured with haptic feedback. Haptic feedback was tested through a teleoperated drawing task. Technical feasibility was established to determine the choice of robots appropriate for requirements of the user and task. 3) Robotic-based virtual assistance was developed and integrated into a single-robot configuration system. Two protocols were designed to validate the system through a usability study with 15 abled-bodied adults. First, an exploration task was performed to evaluate the safety, stability and perceptibility of the virtual assistance. Next, adults performed a set of functional play tasks, i.e. coloring, with and without virtual assistance in order to validate the effectiveness of assistance. Data derived from the robotic system, survey questions and robot usability questionnaires were collected and analyzed. 4) Clinical validation of the system occurred through a single-subject case study with an individual living with cerebral palsy. The individual participated in the same set of coloring tasks using the robotic system as well as her typical computer interface. A comparison of the approaches was performed.      RESULTS: The most researched application areas of haptic robotic systems and their implications for use by children were identified and represented through the retrospective review of the literature  The technical feasibility testing provided the initial set up for the haptic-based manipulation and technical requirements for the user-side and task-side robots in the teleoperation system configuration. Through the usability study with abled-bodied adults, the validity of the technical implementation was confirmed in terms of the systemM-bM-^@M-^Ys safety and stability, and performance. Participants performed significantly better in the coloring tasks when virtual assistance was provided. Both medium and maximum levels of assistance significantly outperformed the unassisted condition and led to relatively the same performance improvements. The study with the individual with cerebral palsy confirmed the effectiveness of the system in leveraging her manual capabilities in a functional manipulative task requiring coordination and fine motor skills. Her typical approach using the computer interface showed considerably less effectiveness compared to the robotic-based approach with assistance in performing the tasks." ;

    ns2:abstract "Magnesium remarkably deserves considerable interest from industry especially transportation sector because of its high strength to weight ratio. However, poor wear resistance and low corrosion resistance of magnesium are barriers to extend use of its alloys. Yttrium is one of rare-earth elements which has been demonstrated effectiveness in improving the corrosion resistance and tribological properties of some metallic alloys. In this work, the effects of yttrium on wear, corrosion and corrosive wear of as-cast Mg-3 wt% Al and AZ31 alloys were investigated. It was shown that the added yttrium increased the dry wear resistance of the alloys through the formation of a harder second phases. The corrosion resistance of the alloys was evaluated in tap water and salt solution. A small amount of added Y improved the corrosion resistance but such benefit decreased at higher yttrium contents. Corrosive wear tests were performed in the same environment for the alloys. The improvement in corrosive wear resistance mainly came from the reduction of corrosion-wear synergy caused by the added yttrium, which increased both hardness and corrosion resistance. Relevant mechanisms to express the observations and the correlation between the performance and microstructure were analyzed and discussed in details. In addition to modification of the corrosion potential of bulk magnesium through alloying elements, tailoring its surface oxide film is an alternative approach for enhanced resistance to corrosion. In this study, effects of small amounts of a yttrium on the strength of surface oxide film formed on Mg-3 wt% Al alloy and its adherence to the substrate were investigated. It is demonstrated that the yttrium addition decreased the component ratio of hydroxides to oxides, mainly Mg(OH)2 to MgO, in the surface oxide film, leading to markedly enhanced mechanical strength and resistance to scratch with stronger adherence to the substrate. However, as the nominal yttrium concentration exceeded a certain level, the beneficial effect of Y on the film was weakened. Efforts were made to clarify underlying mechanisms. Surface modification is an effective approach for increasing wear and corrosion resistance of materials without affecting their bulk properties. Among various surface modification techniques, aluminizing is an economical and effective one which has been applied to various alloys. The effectiveness of aluminizing might be further enhanced by alloying with rare earth elements such as yttrium. In this research, effects of yttrium-incorporated aluminizing on the resistance of AZ31 alloy to corrosion, wear, and corrosive wear were investigated. The study demonstrates that aluminizing can be beneficial to the resistance of the alloy to wear, corrosion and corrosive wear. The addition of yttrium increased the benefits, largely attributed to the associated passive film. Effectiveness of aluminizing can be further enhanced by surface nanocrystallization. In this study, effects of surface  nanocrystallization on the effectiveness of aluminizing in enhancing the resistance of AZ31 alloy to corrosion, wear and corrosive wear were investigated. The results demonstrated that aluminizing was effective to increase the resistance of the Mg alloy to surface failures. Surface nanocrystallization expanded the improvement, largely attributed to increased surface hardness and enhanced passivation capability." ;

Previous studies suggest that the functional response properties of activated brain microglia varied according to the brain region they were derived from, suggesting that these activation profiles are a function of their local environment. CNS microglia are a heterogeneous population of cells whose immune function is determined by local environment, severity of injury and age of the animal. The functional profiles of microglia derived from the spinal cord have not previously been investigated. Here, cell culture methods were used to probe the morphological and secretory response profiles of spinal cord microglia in response to activating stimuli. Our results suggest that spinal cord microglia may be less pro-inflammatory on activation through various models of injury or environmental condition. These differences between microglial activation pathways in spinal cord microglia as compared to brain microglia are an important consideration in rational design of immune-modulatory or anti-inflammatory therapies specific for spinal cord and brain injuries." ;

    ns2:abstract "RNA interference (RNAi) has enabled the study of gene function with unprecedented specificity and reliability. Almost twenty years after the discovery of RNAi, we now know that this process is carried out by a set of evolutionarily conserved proteins. In mammals, these proteins form part of the miRNA pathway that controls the expression of most protein-encoding genes. At the core of the miRNA pathway are Argonaute proteins, which are guided by miRNAs to downregulate the expression of more than 50% of all mRNAs. While there is a vast literature describing how miRNAs regulate numerous cellular pathways, comparatively less is known about how miRNA pathways are modulated. Because of their role in gene expression on a global level, miRNA pathways must clearly be subjected to extensive regulation. Recent findings indicate that post-transcriptional modifications of Argonaute proteins are important for this process. Human Argonaute 2 is phosphorylated on at least seven amino acid residues but we know very little about the function consequences of these modifications. Furthermore, very little is known about the kinases and phosphatases that catalyze these modifications. One unexpected finding in my thesis research is that changes in phosphorylation can lead to profound changes in the localization of Argonaute proteins without dramatically affecting their gene-silencing functions. Using a screen biased to detect kinases that regulate the late stages of RNAi, I identified a large number of kinases that decrease or increased RNAi activity. Few kinases were found to inhibit RNAi activity, but interestingly, the majority were tyrosine kinases. Among this group, FGFR3 was further examined and its effects on RNAi activity were studied in detail. Of note, I showed that stimulation of multiple FGFR family members inhibit RNAi, likely through phosphorylation of Argonaute proteins. Finally, I showed that Argonaute 2 interacts with the serine/threonine phosphatase PP1 and that elevated expression of PP1 inhibits RNAi activity." ;

    ns3:subject "CECR2" ;
    ns8:abstract "Eukaryotic nuclear DNA is packaged into chromatin, a complex nucleoprotein structure. This has functional consequences by controlling the accessibility of DNA to binding factors responsible for many important cellular processes such as transcription, DNA replication and DNA repair. ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes such as the ISWI family can regulate these cellular processes by altering the chromatin structure. CECR2 is a chromatin remodeling factor that forms a complex with ISWI proteins SNF2H and SNF2L. Loss-of-function mutations in Cecr2 result in the perinatal lethal neural tube defect, exencephaly. Nonpenetrant animals that survive to adulthood exhibit subfertility. CECR2 loss affects transcription of multiple genes and is also involved in M-NM-3-H2AX formation and DSB repair. The mutant phenotypes indicate that CECR2 plays an important role in neural tube development and reproduction, but the mechanism of its function is not known. I therefore have investigated the components of the CECR2 complex and its chromatin binding sites in ES cells and testis. I hypothesized that the CECR2 complexes contain tissue-specific components that may correspond to tissue-specific functions in ES cells and testis. I also hypothesized that the CECR2 containing complexes occupy different chromatin binding sites. This work first required the development of a highly specific CECR2-specific antibody. I confirmed that CECR2 forms a complex with SNF2H and SNF2L both in mouse ES cells and in testes. I showed that the CECR2-containing complex in mouse ES cells and testes has a size of approximately 2 MDa, suggesting the presence of additional components in the complex. Mass spectrometric analysis of CECR2-containing complexes revealed novel binding partners of CECR2 in ES cells and adult testis. I identified CCAR2 as a new member of the CECR2-containing complex in ES cells and possibly testis. CCAR2 has been shown to be involved in DNA damage response, which is also a known function of CECR2. Strikingly, there is a difference in the composition of complexes isolated from ES cells and adult testis. LUZP1 (leucine zipper protein 1) was confirmed to be a binding partner of CECR2 only in mouse ES cells and not in testes. Luzp1 mutant mice display exencephaly in 42% of embryos, indicating its role in neural tube closure. LUZP1 appears to play a role in stabilizing the CECR2 complex. I showed that the CECR2 complexes have different components, which opens the door toward understanding the multiple functions of CECR2.  Disruption of Cecr2 results in dysregulation of expression of many genes in mouse embryos, however the direct transcriptional targets of the CECR2 complexes are unknown. Therefore, to find the direct binding sites of the CECR2 complex, chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis was performed in ES cells and adult testis. Looking at the overlapping binding sites of CECR2 and SNF2H allowed for a more powerful analysis and investigating the additional overlap with the binding sites of LUZP1 in ES cells allowed me to look for the ES cell-specific binding sites. Little overlap of CECR2 binding sites between ES cells and testes was observed, suggesting tissue-specific transcriptional regulation. Analysis of the ChIP-seq data revealed that the CECR2 complex occupies the promoter and cis-regulatory regions of many genes.  The identified genes in ES cells are involved in different aspects of embryonic development including brain, heart and kidney development. The Cecr2 mutants exhibit abnormalities in these three organs. Gene ontology (GO) analyses of the genes associated with the binding sites of the CECR2 complex in ES cells showed that this complex modulates important molecular pathways including Shh and Wnt signaling. The genes identified in testes are involved in different aspects of reproduction and development. I identified many candidate genes that can be used to investigate the CECR2 function in neurulation and fertility. Hsd17b2, Lpar1, Nf, Lrp6 and Phactr4 are possibly directly regulated by the CECR2 complex, all of which cause exencephaly when mutated. Elmo1, Fgfr4, Ggt1, Insr, Itgb3 and Schip1 from the ES cell dataset and Cdc14b, Nfia, Pcsk1 and Styx from the testis dataset are candidate genes involved in reproduction. My findings revealed that there are ES and testis-specific CECR2 complexes in mice. I showed that these complexes have different compositions and chromatin binding sites, which will facilitate understanding the multiple functions of CECR2 during development and reproduction." ;

    ns3:abstract "This study investigates the process of nation-building in the Republic of Moldova. It bridges the national revival of the Romanian-speaking Moldovans with the rise of anti-Moldovan resistance and pro-Russian separatism in the self-proclaimed Transnistrian republic. The results indicate that the unsettled identities in the Soviet and Romanian past, the dysfunctional Moldovan nationhood, and RussiaM-bM-^@M-^Ys involvement in this protracted conflict impede national reconciliation and disrupt state building in this European borderland. This work reveals that, similar to Donbas region and Crimea in Ukraine, Russo-centric separatism is the main driving factor for the political disunity and territorial fragmentation in the Republic of Moldova. This is an interdisciplinary project. It involves history as well as studies in ethnicity, culture, nationalism, conflictology, political sciences, and international relations. It addresses such issues as the influence of historical preconditions on the nation-building in the territory of modern-day Moldova and the reasons for its failures in the past. The study also examines the impact that the pro- and pan-Romanian nationalism of the Romanian speakers and the growing centrifugalism of Russian-speaking minorities had on the geopolitical situation in this country since the late Soviet era and during the first two decades of independence. The dissertation relies on the premise that the construction of a small-sized nation, based on ethnocentric or civic principles, is determined by the ability of the local elites to negotiate and resolve domestic political disputes, where the involvement of foreign actors is crucial. This work describes the secessionist movement in the Republic of Moldova as a domestic, yet an internationalized impediment for the Euro-Atlantic integration of the country.  There are three central working assumptions in this study. First, the collapse of the USSR did not prevent Russia from interfering in the domestic affairs of the former sister-republics. On the contrary, protracted conflicts like the Transnistrian conflict contributed to RussiaM-bM-^@M-^Ys reaffirmation as a regional power; such conflicts demonstrated that the strategy employed by the Kremlin toward the M-bM-^@M-^\near abroadM-bM-^@M-^] aims at strengthening the geopolitical domination of the Russian Federation and challenging the West. The second working assumption is that the term M-bM-^@M-^\frozen conflictM-bM-^@M-^] is inappropriate for the Transnistria problem. This term is a source of confusion, as it neither reflects the real state of affairs in the Republic of Moldova, nor does it correspond to other similar conflicts beyond its international borders (e.g. in Georgia). The third is the presupposition that the irreconcilable legacy of the Romanian and Soviet past, the conflicting foreign and domestic policies implemented by the leadership, and the geopolitical orientation of ordinary citizens have transformed the Republic of Moldova into a hostage of a continuing crisis. This hampers nation-building, prevents national reconciliation, and challenges its geopolitical choice M-bM-^@M-^S either to become part of the Western world, or to remain a vulnerable target for MoscowM-bM-^@M-^Ys political ambitions, similar to Georgia or Ukraine." ;

    ns5:abstract "Apoptosis serves as a powerful defense against damaged and unwanted cells. The family of Bcl-2 proteins plays a key role in the regulation of apoptosis at the mitochondria. Members of the Bcl-2 family include pro- and anti-apoptotic members that collectively determine the state of the cell. Apoptosis is an effective defense against viral infection, and many viruses, including poxviruses, encode proteins to prevent or delay apoptosis. In this thesis, we demonstrate that ectromelia virus, the causative agent of lethal mousepox, encodes an inhibitor of apoptosis, EVM025. EVM025 is the orthologue of VACV F1, previously shown to inhibit apoptosis. EVM025 contains a large N-terminal repeat and a C-terminal domain that is essential for localization to the mitochondria. Cells infected with ECTV lacking EVM025 undergo apoptosis, highlighting the importance of the anti-apoptotic activity of EVM025. We further demonstrate that expression of EVM025 is crucial to prevent apoptosis triggered by various stimulations. Expression of EVM025 prevents the activation of Bak and Bax and maintains mitochondrial membrane integrity upon infection with ECTV. Our virulence studies have established that ECTVM-bM-^HM-^F025 is highly attenuated in mice, with virus only being detected in the draining lymph node (D-LN) following footpad inoculation. ECTVM-bM-^HM-^F025 was unable to escape the D-LN and replicate in other organs such as spleen, kidney and liver. Our studies show that the T cell response is required to limit the spread of the virus beyond the D-LN.  The vaccinia virus Copenhagen (VACV) E3 protein is essential for virus replication in a wide range of cells. E3 dampens various innate immune responses by inhibiting PKR, thus maintaining efficient protein translation over the course of a virus infection cycle. In addition to being an inhibitor of PKR, E3 has also been associated with the inhibition of cellular apoptosis. In this thesis we confirmed that infection with VACVM-NM-^TE3L triggers the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, and leads to the cleavage of Caspase-3 and eventual cell death. However, our data suggest that E3 does not directly inhibit the intrinsic apoptotic pathway; instead, it suppresses apoptosis indirectly, by promoting the accumulation of the VACV anti-apoptotic F1 protein. F1 mRNA is present in cells infected VACVM-bM-^HM-^FE3L but the protein product does not detectably accumulate, suggesting a block at the translational level. F1 expression is restored by ectopic expression of E3 or by knocking out PKR, reversing the pro-apoptotic phenotype of VACVM-bM-^HM-^FE3L." ;

    ns1:abstract "Fluorescent proteins (FPs) have dramatically advanced life science research. Since their discovery they have become invaluable tools for imaging living systems and have been developed into precision instruments for measuring normally invisible events such as fluctuations in calcium ion concentration, protein-protein interactions (PPi), and even membrane voltage. More surprisingly, FPs have now been converted into optogenetic actuators capable of manipulating the biochemistry of the cell. There is substantial interest in improving both the diversity and quality of available FPs because of their great utility and potential. In this thesis, I describe my efforts to design better methods to easily improve FPs and I use these methods to create a variety of new FP variants. First, I explored the potential of developing FPs as tandem dimers. I used directed evolution to create a series of heterodimeric FPs called the vine Tomatoes (vTs). Specifically, I created green-green (GGvT), green-red (GRvT), and red-red (RRvT) heterodimers by genetically fusing two tightly dimerizing FP domains and then evolving as a pair. This allows the two monomers to differentiate, creating tandem heterodimers with advanced characteristics such as exceptionally high FRET efficiency in GRvT of 99%, and the brightest red fluorescent protein to date with RRvT at 120. Next I developed a robot-assisted screening system for photostability screening. This simplified screening process led to the development of Citrine2, a variant with 9-fold improvement in photostability relative to its precursor, mCitrine. I also observed that concentration plays a significant role in photostability, and I so I attempted to modify this property. With only five mutations, the concentration dependence of photostability switched from being an inverse relationship in mCitrine, to a direct relationship in Citrine2. From there I switched to developing new screening systems for photocleavable proteins. Several different screening systems based on bimolecular fluorescence complementation and FRET were developed to screen directly for the photoinduced dissociation of a photocleavable protein (PhoCl) developed in our lab. A second photocleavable protein called SplitOr was created from PSmOrange2. The goal was to develop a spectrally orthogonal photocleavable protein that could be photocleaved with wavelengths of light that do not cause PhoCl photocleavage. PSmOrange2 was circularly permuted and its fluorescence and photoconversion properties rescued, creating three new versions of SplitOr with photophysical characteristics that suggest photocleavage is occurring. Altogether, these projects have advanced the field of FP development. I created three research-ready FPs, RRvT, GRvT, and Citrine2; I developed and characterized a rapid, low cost, robot-assisted illumination system which will aid our lab and others in the development of photostable FP variants; I advanced our knowledge of photocleavable proteins by developing an evolution system for the photocleavable protein PhoCl; and finally I created an orthogonal photocleavable protein that may find use as an optogenetic actuator." ;

Two primary MSSM neutral Higgs production modes, gluon-gluon fusion and in association with b-quarks, are considered. The analysis presented here searches for events where the neutral Higgs bosons decay to a $\\tau^+\\tau^-$ pair with one $\\tau$ decaying to leptons ($e/\\mu$) and the other $\\tau$ decaying to hadrons. The data are in good agreement with the background predicted by the Standard Model and the results provide an upper limit on the production cross section times branching fraction of the scalar boson decay to $\\tau^+\\tau^-$ as a function of the boson mass. The results are also interpreted in the $m_h^{mod+}$ MSSM benchmark scenario to derive exclusion limits on the $m_{A/H}-\\tan\\beta$ plane." ;

    ns7:abstract "The following dissertation examines narratives of immigration to Western Europe, Israel and North America authored by Russian-speaking writers of Jewish decent, born in the Soviet Union after World War II.  The project seeks to investigate representations of resettlement experiences and cultural identity construction in the literature of the post-1970s Russian-Jewish diaspora.  The seven authors whose selected works comprise the corpus of analysis write in Russian, German and English, reflecting the complex performative nature of their own multilayered identities.  The authors included are Dina Rubina, Liudmila Ulitskaia, Wladimir Kaminer, Lara Vapnyar, Gary Shteyngart, Irina Reyn, and David Bezmozgis.  The corpus is a selection of fictional and semi-autobiographical narratives that focus on cultural displacement and the subsequent renegotiation of M-bM-^@M-^XselfM-bM-^@M-^Y following immigration.  In the 1970s and final years of Communist rule, over one million Soviet citizens of Jewish heritage immigrated to Western Europe, Israel and North America.  Inhospitable government policies towards Soviet citizens identified as Jewish and social traditions of anti-Semitism precipitated this mass exodus.  After escaping prejudice within the Soviet system, these Jewish immigrants were marginalized in their adopted homelands as Russians.  The following study of displacement and relocation draws on Homi BhabhaM-bM-^@M-^Ys theories of othering and unhomeliness.  The analyzed works demonstrate both culturally based othering and unhomely experiences pre- and post-immigration resulting from relegation to the periphery of society.  Based upon the concept of performativity developed by Judith Butler, this study maintains that the cultural display of self is a performative act which manifests in a variety of ways.    Chapter One presents the research problem, introduces the corpus of analysis, discusses the concepts of unhomeliness, identity and performativity as theoretical tools, provides a justification of the methodological framework being utilized, and finally positions Russian-Jewish post-immigration literature within the canon of diasporic world literature.  Chapter Two focuses on a contextualization of Russian-Jewish character portrayal from a historical perspective, charting the metamorphosis of the Wandering Jew, as first conceived of by Christian society, through this enduring figureM-bM-^@M-^Ys transformation beyond stereotyped caricature.  This study postulates that contemporary Russian-Jewish authors have reclaimed the literary image of the Wandering Jew as their own, effectively reconfiguring the character for their post-immigration narratives of displacement.  As this project shows, the multilayering of cultural influences often results in ambiguous conceptualizations of self, a common feature of the literary make-up of Russian-Jewish post-immigration protagonists.  Such ambiguity is often accompanied by a desire for self-definition and is frequently associated with the geroi khudozhnik (artist figure), who symbolically embodies post-immigration identity renegotiation.  The artist appears regularly in these works as the perpetual creator and designer, who is equally engaged in the ongoing reformulation and shaping of his/her own post-immigration identity.  Chapter Three focuses on the literary construction of post-immigration spaces and how they both inform and reflect cultural distinctiveness.  Through examinations of unhomeliness, nostalgia, and the search for belonging, the project approaches representations of both physical and symbolic spaces as culturally significant.  Chapter Four deals with the construct of performativity as it applies to displays of cultural identity.  The chapter explores the culturally performative actions of post-immigration protagonists through the consideration of established character types, language usage, and the physical presentation of self in connection with multilayered identity.    By identifying significant themes common to the projectM-bM-^@M-^Ys literary corpus the symbolic implications of everyday choices made by the analyzed characters exemplify the importance of understanding Russian-Jewish post-immigration experiences.  The present comparative literary investigation of seven authors from this group demonstrates how the presence of multiple simultaneous cultural influences -- Soviet, Russian, Jewish, German, Israeli, American, Canadian M-bM-^@M-^S results in highly specific and complex presentations of ongoing identity negotiation." ;

    ns1:abstract "Tuberculosis (TB) remains a global health problem. Incorrect or missed serodiagnosis for TB, especially in resource-limited settings, is one of the main reasons for TB epidemics. Clinically, serological tests that use circulating antibodies are attractive because antibodies in serum are present at higher concentration than disease biomarkers, making detection of disease-specific antibodies easier. However, the accuracy of a serological test is highly dependent on the antigens used in the test; existing serological tests for TB provide inconsistent specificities and sensitivities. This issue is further aggravated by the heterogeneity and complexity of the glycolipid antigen across mycobacteria species, which makes rational design of discriminatory antigens difficult. This thesis approaches these challenges, i.e. the need for simpler and more efficient antigens with high specificity for TB diagnoses, by combining fragment-based discovery with phage display. Through anchoring each genetically-encoded displayed peptide on phage to a small molecule fragment, I constructed glycopeptide libraries that demonstrated their application for the selection of promising antigens for antibodies associated with mycobacterial infections. By using an anti-LAM antibody CS-35 as a model target, I discovered novel hexasaccharide-peptide conjugates with KD value 10-fold better than that of the hexasaccahride itself (Chapter 2). The selectivity and affinity of these conjugates enhanced modestly when constructed in multivalent presentation and tested in multivalent binding assays. Interestingly, when the hexasaccharide on these conjugates were truncated to monosaccharides, their binding affinity drastically diminished, suggesting that some, if not all, monosaccahrides in the hexasaccharide must be present to elicit constructive antigen-antibody interactions (Chapter 3). Consequently, I demonstrated a site-selective dual modification strategy to create the first phage displayed macrocyclic glycopeptide library that present two carbohydrate moieties per peptide. The peptide library can be glycosylated first using sodium periodate cleavage on N-terminal serine followed by oxime ligation; the second glycosylation was achieved through alkylation on disulfides using a dichloro-oxime derivative. These libraries show potential for use in fragment-based ligand discovery, and selection for TB-specific antibodies. Finally, I developed a deep-panning system that combines single-round selection with deep sequencing to afford rapid and unbiased selection. The system has been validated on model target ConA and antiFLAG antibody, and will strongly complement the fragment-based ligand discovery to identify disease-specific antigens using serum from diseased patients." ;

    ns4:abstract "Much of the work on Prion Protein (PrPC) and Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) biology has focused on the contributions of their misfolded forms or aggregated metabolites to prion diseases and AlzheimerM-bM-^@M-^Ys disease, respectively. As subversion/partial loss of some normal functions are also likely contributors to these disease states, it is also important to understand the normal functions of these proteins in healthy organisms. Zebrafish are an attractive model organism for uncovering conserved (and hence important) functions of PrPC and APP because their CNS resembles that of mammals, and their genetic tractability can be harnessed to identify protein functional domains (eg. by M-bM-^@M-^XrescuingM-bM-^@M-^Y a phenotype in loss-of-function mutants with modified mRNAs). Here we created loss-of-function mutants of zebrafish homologs of PrPC and APP (prp1 and appa) to identify normal functions of these proteins, using Tal-Effector Nuclease gene targeting. We also bred the perp-/- mutants to our existing prp2-/- mutants to test for redundancy between prp1 and prp2, and created compound prp1-/-;appa-/- mutants to identify functional interactions between PrPC and APP. We did not observe overt phenotypes in any of the single mutants or compound mutants generated, likely due to genetic and/or physiological redundancy. We went on to challenge the prion protein mutants first with acute loss of a second gene and later with a convulsant. We also looked for subtle phenotypes in neural development by examining an accessible neural tissue in zebrafish larvae- the posterior lateral line, and searched for cognitive deficits in adult prp2-/- mutants using behavioural tests.   We found that acute loss of appa, achieved using morpholino gene knockdown, in prp1-/- mutants produced an early developmental phenotype. These developmental defects could be partly reversed or M-bM-^@M-^XrescuedM-bM-^@M-^Y by delivering either prp1 mRNA or mouse Prnp to one-cell staged zebrafish embryos. These experiments confirmed our previous finding that prp1 and appa interact genetically. We also found that prp1 and prp2 have redundant roles in modulating neural activity (measured indirectly by quantifying c-fos abundance) during exposure to the convulsant, PTZ. Further, both prp1 and prp2 participate in the development of the zebrafish lateral line neuromasts. Finally, using an object recognition test and novel object approach test, we showed that zebrafish lacking the prp2 paralog have age-dependent deficits in object recognition memory and cognitive appraisal.  The zebrafish PrPC and APP loss-of-function mutants and assays that we have developed herein will be used to further dissect the molecular mechanisms through which these proteins participate in neural development, neural activity, and ultimately memory and cognition. For example, M-bM-^@M-^XrescueM-bM-^@M-^Y experiments, wherein modified versions of Prnp and APP mRNA are injected into zebrafish embryos, can be used to determine which PrPC and APP protein domains mediate their normal functions. Such information will be useful for the design of AlzheimerM-bM-^@M-^Ys disease and prion disease therapeutics." ;

    ns3:abstract "For many investors, such as mutual fund managers, the closing price of a stock is an important benchmark. The closing price for stocks traded at NASDAQ is determined through an auction, like at many other stock exchanges. Each day and for each stock traded at NASDAQ, the intertemporal order imbalance of the auction is announced beginning ten minutes before the close. We introduce a mathematical framework that takes the order imbalance announcements into account, and then derive an optimal trading algorithm for flow trades, whose benchmark is the closing price. Under suitable assumptions, we find explicit formulas for the optimal trading strategy and that it is not beneficial for the investor to trade after the imbalance announcement. However, in addition to participating in the auction, the investor trades before the imbalance announcement to benefit from prices which do not reflect the later impact of the investor's own auction order. Using real historical data, we simulate the performance of the proposed algorithm and find a small, but persistent out-of-sample improvement and a reduction in average trading costs." ;

        "Water-energy nexus" ;
    ns2:abstract "The water-energy nexus refers to the relationship between water and energy, wherein each one needs the other. This thesis examines that part of the water-energy nexus concerned with water needed for energy production, conversion, and utilization. There has been limited focus on assessing the life cycle water footprints of energy pathways. Such an approach assesses the water requirement for the various unit operations in energy pathways from fuel extraction to its final energy form. A study of the life cycle water footprints of different energy pathways with a focus on minimizing water use could help in policy formation and investment decisions. The main objective of this research is to establish a benchmark for water demand coefficients for energy pathways based on a complete life cycle. The focus is on the assessment of different energy pathways and development of life cycle water demand coefficients through comprehensive modeling. The research includes the evaluation of energy pathways based on both conventional and non-conventional sources of energy, and the energy sources assessed are coal, natural gas, oil, biomass, wind, solar, hydroelectricity, nuclear, and geothermal. The initial focus is on power production. The conversion efficiency of power generation is correlated to developed water demand coefficients to study the effect of a power plantM-bM-^@M-^Ys performance on water use. Coal-based power generation has high water use compared to gas-fired power generation due to differences both in conversion efficiency and the unit operations of fuel extraction. Biomass-based power generation has the highest water demand coefficients over the complete life cycle and wind has the lowest. This study found complete life cycle water consumption coefficients for power generation for coal transported by conventional means to be 0.96 M-bM-^@M-^S 3.21 L/kWh and 0.07 M-bM-^@M-^S 2.57 L/kWh for gas-fired power plants. Excluding biomass and hydroelectricity pathways, non-conventional energy technology has complete life cycle water consumption coefficients of 0.005 M-bM-^@M-^S 4.39 L/kWh. The corresponding range for biomass pathways is 259.6 M-bM-^@M-^S 1164.01 L/kWh. Throughout the complete life cycle of a transportation fuel produced from the oil sands in Alberta 2.08 M-bM-^@M-^S 4.19 volume of water per volume of oil are consumed, and the corresponding fuel from crude oil extracted from five selected oil fields in North America consumes 1.71 M-bM-^@M-^S 8.25 volume of fresh water per volume of oil.   The water demand coefficients developed in this study could be used in making decision regarding selection of water efficient pathways." ;

    ns1:abstract "This research presents a performance-based design procedure for steel plate shear wall (SPSW) systems with explicit consideration of plastic mechanisms, inelastic drift demands and frame actions. The proposed design procedure generally adopts the philosophy of a recently developed performance-based plastic design (PBPD) methodology in which an energy-work balance concept is employed to produce structures with targeted seismic performance, taking advantage of plastic analysis method and capacity design principles. The intention is to address some of the shortcomings of current SPSW design practice. Based on extensive nonlinear response-history analyses of SPSWs having different bay widths and overall heights, a simple empirical expression was proposed for predicting yield drift ratio, which is an essential parameter to be used at the beginning of the design process. A step-by-step design procedure was presented and various design parameters were studied. The validity of the proposed design approach was tested by evaluating the seismic behaviour of case study SPSWs designed for buildings located in Canada and the U.S. having different seismic hazard levels. Next, the proposed approach was used as a reliable design procedure to perform a comprehensive study of alternative SPSW configurations, aiming to improve some of the drawbacks of the conventional SPSW systems. As such, the design procedure was further extended to include two other SPSW configurations, namely (1) SPSW with Outriggers (SPSW-O) and (2) Coupled SPSW (C-SPSW). The above-mentioned SPSW configurations are intended to enhance the overturning stiffness of SPSWs, while improving material efficiency and providing architectural flexibility. The plastic method of structural analysis was used to investigate the behaviour, mechanisms and efficiency of these SPSW configurations, and to develop procedures for efficient design of such structural systems.  Four different SPSW-O options were discussed and their structural characteristics were investigated in terms of lateral load resistance and overturning stiffness. A simple parameter called the outrigger efficiency factor (OEF) was defined to quantify the level of the overturning stiffness provided by the outrigger system; this allows for the comparison of various SPSW-Os on a consistent basis. Closed form analytical expressions that capture the ultimate lateral strength and OEF SPSW-Os were developed and compared with numerical simulations with reasonable agreement. Furthermore, a comprehensive parametric study was conducted to investigate the influence of a number of parameters on the behaviour of SPSW-O systems. Parameters subjected to investigation included the height of the systems, the length and properties of the outrigger beams, and the types of beam-to-column connections used in the systems. Subsequently, 12- and 20-story SPSW-O systems were designed using the proposed design procedure; and their seismic performances were evaluated under a suite of 20 ground motions representing the design-level earthquakes. Further, the proposed design approach was extended to the coupled SPSW systems considering two different options, namely (1) C-SPSW with simple boundary frame connections and (2) C-SPSW with moment-resisting boundary frame connections. The C-SPSW configuration constitutes a dual system in which a substantial proportion of the story shear is resisted through the moment-resisting actions of the coupling beams and boundary frame elements. The principles of plastic analysis and capacity design were used to develop procedures for efficient designs of the two C-SPSW options by explicitly considering the contributions of the frame actions to the overall lateral strengths of such systems. This was done by estimating an appropriate proportion of the design force that should be used to size the infill plates within each system. Eight and 12-story C-SPSWs were designed using the proposed procedures, along with two uncoupled pairs of SPSWs designed for comparison. A series of nonlinear response history and pushover analyses were conducted to evaluate and compare the seismic performances of the prototypes." ;

    ns2:abstract "BCR-ABL fusion oncogene is the main driver mutation of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) that controls initiation, maintenance and progression to more aggressive stages of the disease. Current therapies with tyrosine kinase inhibitors in CML involve certain limitations, such as drug resistance and insensitivity. Therefore, RNA interference (RNAi) represents a promising tool for the silencing of over-expressed genes that can regulate unwanted biological effects produced in diseases such as cancer. CML arises from the acquisition of the BCR-ABL oncogene in normal hematopoietic stem cells that progressively outgrow the normal hematopoietic stem cells in the stem cell niche and subsequently leads to an uncontrolled expansion of immature myeloid cells. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) used to target the ABL tyrosine kinase have shown significantly increased clinical outcomes in CML patients, however, patients in blast crisis phase are more likely to relapse and develop resistance often due to mutations in the TKI domain and innate or acquired insensitivity of CML stem cells. RNAi represents a promising alternative for the treatment of CML as small interference RNA (siRNA) molecules can be applied to the silencing of specific targets that modulate the biological outcome and induce therapeutic effects. However, potent carriers that can overcome delivery barriers of RNAi agents and are effective in difficult-to-transfect cells, such as CML cells, are needed for the progression of siRNA-based therapies towards clinical applications. In this thesis work, we explored the use of lipid-modified polyethylenimines (PEI) of low molecular weights (0.6, 1.2, 2.0 kDa) in in vitro and in vivo CML models and evaluated their siRNA transfection efficiency in terms of cytotoxicity, siRNA uptake, internalization, gene silencing and biological effects (i.e, apoptosis, cell growth, and cell colony growth). siRNA transfection efficiency of lipid-modified polymers was evaluated in CML K562 cell lines grown in suspension and adhering to a fibronectin (FN) surface, in an in vivo CML (K562) model, and in CML patient cells. The hypothesis of this thesis is that lipid-modified polymers will facilitate siRNA delivery to CML cells efficiently to obtain functional outcomes that could be potentially used as therapy for CML. Among the lipid substituents evaluated for PEI modification, palmitic acid (PA), alpha linoleic acid (LA), and cholesterol (Chol) have proven to be highly efficient in delivering siRNA and silencing of the green fluorescent protein (GFP)- reporter gene in K562 cells grown in vitro in suspension (PA, LA, and Chol) and on K562 cells grown adhering to FN-modified surfaces (LA). Moreover, BCR-ABL-siRNA transfection produced a significant decrease of BCR-ABL mRNA in K562 cells (PA, LA, and Chol) and CML primary cells (LA, and Chol) which subsequently resulted in significant increase of apoptotic cells, cell growth inhibition, and reduced ability to form cell colonies in vitro in comparison with control groups. Although a decrease in BCR-ABL mRNA was not evident in CML models in vivo, a retardation in the tumor growth was observed in comparison with control groups. The results from this study revealed the potential of siRNA-based drugs and are encouraging for the future design of non-viral delivery system with clinical translation capabilities for the treatment of CML. This thesis work provides ample opportunities for delivery systems that could be useful to silence other target genes in CML and other leukemias (i.e., acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia) for therapeutic purposes." ;

    ns8:abstract "The occurrence of hearing loss increases markedly with age. Given that the population in Alberta is aging, hearing loss is expected to affect an increasing proportion of people in this province in the coming years. Research indicates that approximately half of adults in Canada with hearing loss are underserved. Aural rehabilitation (AR) services, which can include the assessment/screening of hearing, selection/fitting dispensing of hearing aids/listening devices, and post-fitting rehabilitation (such as adjustment counselling) are considered to be of benefit to adults with hearing loss. AR falls primarily within the scope of practice of three professional groups in Canada: audiologists, hearing-aid practitioners (HAPs) (also known as hearing-instrument practitioners), and speech-language pathologists (SLPs). Prior to conducting this project, very little was known about the delivery of AR services to adults in Alberta. As such, the present study is primarily an investigation of AR services provided by these groups to adults in the province. This thesis contains two studies. The purpose of Study I was to describe the current state of AR services for adults in Alberta. In order to do so, a survey was made available to all SLPs, audiologists, and HAPs registered to practice in Alberta. Other known providers of AR services (e.g., speechreading instructors and psychologists) were also invited to participate. Descriptive and inferential statistics were utilized to analyze survey data. The purpose of Study II was to describe the perceptions of SLPs regarding SLP provision of AR services. Within this study, interviews were conducted with SLPs. Interview data were analyzed using a qualitative description approach.  Findings revealed that most audiologists and HAPs reported that they provide AR services to adult clients, while very few SLPs reported that they do so. A small group of other professionals, including psychologists, speechreading instructors, and AR specialists also reported that they provide AR services to this population. In terms of the services provided, the main focus of audiologists is reported to be the assessment of hearing, while HAPs reported that their focus is primarily on the selection/fitting/dispensing of hearing aids/listening devices. Members of each of the three main professional groups reported providing post-fitting rehabilitation services to adults.  A comparison of professionalsM-bM-^@M-^Y perceived roles/responsibilities in AR with the services they deliver in practice revealed that SLPs are not using the full-range of their knowledge and skills in AR to deliver services to adults. SLPs explained that barriers, such as their lack of confidence to deliver AR services, make it difficult to provide these services. If SLPs are to increase their involvement in delivering AR services to adults with hearing loss in the future, the following changes are recommended: greater interprofessional collaboration between SLPs and other providers of AR; opportunities for SLPs to practice hands-on AR skills within coursework, clinical practica, and post-professional training; and SLP governing body advocacy with regard to the importance of AR services (in particular post-fitting rehabilitation services) for the well-being of adults with hearing loss. SLPs have the potential to increase their involvement in the delivery of AR services to adults in Alberta, and as a result, better serve the growing population of adults with hearing loss in the province." ;

    ns5:abstract "Drinking water disinfection effectively kills pathogens and prevents waterborne diseases, but it also generates a large number of water disinfection byproducts (DBPs). Epidemiological studies have consistently linked long-term consumption of chlorinated water with an increased risk of developing bladder cancer; however, the responsible DBP or DBPs have not been identified. Halobenzoquinones (HBQs) are an emerging class of DBPs that are predicted to be potent bladder carcinogens. However, little is known about the toxicological effects of HBQs. This thesis investigated the cytotoxicity and potential mechanism of toxicity induced by HBQs.  The cytotoxicity of HBQs was demonstrated in several cell lines: T24 human bladder carcinoma cells, CHO-K1 Chinese hamster ovary cells, and SV-HUC-1 human uroepithelial cells. At M-NM-<M levels HBQs induced significantly higher toxicity than the regulated DBPs. HBQs generated significant intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), weakened the glutathione (GSH) antioxidant system, and caused severe oxidative DNA and protein damage (i.e., increased cellular level of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and protein carbonyls). Additionally, toxicogenomic analysis showed that HBQs activate the nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) antioxidant pathway; the major transcripts differentially up-regulated at both early and late exposure times were HMOX1, followed by NQO1, PTGS2 and TXNRD1. These results support oxidative stress as a key mechanism of HBQ-induced cytotoxicity.   StructureM-bM-^@M-^Stoxicity relationship analysis demonstrated that formation of ROS, cytotoxicity, and genotoxicity were strongly affected by the structure of HBQs (i.e., position, type, and number of substitutions of halogens on the benzoquinone ring). Halogen substitution groups, isomeric structure, and electron distribution were shown to affect toxicity. The cytotoxicity of di-halogenated HBQs followed the trend: iodo- > bromo- > chloro-HBQs. Additionally, 2,5-HBQs induced greater toxicity than their corresponding 2,6-HBQ isomers. Furthermore, HBQ toxicity was influenced by two major structural descriptors: the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy (ELUMO) and dipole moment.   An established human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cell model, expressing specific multidrug resistance proteins (MRPs), was used to indirectly examine the role of MRPs on the cellular export of HBQs. Compared to the HEK-empty vector, HEK-MRP4 cells significantly decreased HBQ cytotoxicity and cellular ROS generation, supporting the role of MRP4 in the cellular detoxification of HBQs. The detoxification of HBQs by MRP4 was dependent on GSH.   This research provides several original contributions to the field. 1) HBQ DBPs can cause high toxicity in multiple human cell lines, and show significantly higher toxicity than regulated DBPs in CHO cells. 2) The structureM-bM-^@M-^Stoxicity analysis of HBQs identified ELUMO and dipole moment as a key parameter of HBQ toxicity. 3) Toxicogenomic analysis supports oxidative stress pathways as one of the key mechanisms of toxicity of HBQ DBPs. 4) The first study of MRPs and the toxicity of DBPs demonstrated the role of MRP4 in detoxifying HBQs. These results provide useful insight into the mechanisms of toxic effects of HBQs in in vitro systems." ;

    ns7:abstract "The field of organic chemistry has seen remarkable advances throughout the decades. Of all advances, catalysis is playing a crucial role, since it can lower the activation energy of normally inert starting materials for further chemical reactions. In this context, the catalytic direct activation and transformation of hydroxyl groups (M-bM-^@M-^SOH) is of significant value since hydroxyl groups exist in numerous commodity chemicals, pharmaceutical agents and natural products. Arylboronic acids can form covalent bonds with hydroxyl groups in a reversible manner, thus providing transient activation, which bypasses the need for wasteful, expensive and often toxic stoichiometric activating reagents. As an emerging mode of catalysis, boronic acid catalysis (BAC) has the potential to be developed into a versatile strategy for direct hydroxyl group functionalization. To this end, BAC has been applied to the direct activation of carboxylic acids, alcohols and oximes. Several new catalytic methods employing novel arylboronic acids are presented in this thesis.  Chapter 2 describes the development of a direct Friedel-Craft alkylation using M-OM-^@-activated alcohols via BAC. Owing to their high Lewis acidity, electron deficient arylboronic acids activate alcohol substrates though polarization of the CM-bM-^@M-^SO bond. Mechanistic investigation revealed that the catalytic reactivity of arylboronic acids is influenced by their ortho-substituents. Moreover, this chapter also details the discovery of a novel cationic ferrocenium boronic acid salt for the efficient Friedel-Crafts benzylation of challenging substrates.  Due to its broad functional group tolerance, BAC can potentially be employed cooperatively with other types of catalytic systems. Chapter 3 describes the development of a dual catalytic methodology, merging boronic acids and chiral amines, for the direct asymmetric allylation of branched aldehydes with allylic alcohols. Through the optimization of boronic acids and various chiral amines, compounds containing valuable all-carbon quaternary centers can be accessed in good yield and high enantioselectivity. This research was also applied in the first catalytic and asymmetric synthesis of a key building block for the synthesis of a NK1/NK3 receptor antagonist.   Other functional groups containing hydroxyl units may also be amenable to BAC. Chapter 4 describes the discovery of a unique class of arylboronic acids with ortho-carboxyesters for catalysis of the Beckmann rearrangement of oximes. A broad substrate scope of oximes with various functional groups is achieved. Further investigations strongly suggest a two-step mechanism comprised of a novel boron induced oxime transesterification and a boron assisted Beckmann rearrangement." ;

    ns4:abstract "Lifestyle behaviours, including diet, physical activity, sleep, and sedentary behaviour, have been shown to be associated both with health outcomes, including childhood obesity, and academic achievement in children and youth. The improvement of these lifestyle behaviours to prevent chronic disease is an important public health priority. In addition, academic success for children is an important target for public health as educational attainment is a key social determinant of health and supports good health across the lifespan. Schools are an ideal place to implement initiatives to improve childrenM-bM-^@M-^Ys lifestyle behaviours. However, further evidence is needed to justify that investments in childrenM-bM-^@M-^Ys healthy lifestyle behaviours are also investments in academic success, and that health promotion in school environments does not detract from, but instead complements, the mandate of schools. The aim of this thesis is to investigate the relationship of diet, physical activity, sleep, screen usage, and body weight status with academic achievement. This aim was addressed through four research objectives, aligned into five research questions. The objectives consisted of assessing the relationship between lifestyle behaviour recommendations and academic achievement taking into consideration socioeconomic factors, assessing the independent and combined importance of meeting recommendations for lifestyle behaviours, and discussing considerations for the assessment of the relationship between physical activity and academic achievement. To achieve these objectives, I employed data from three, population-based surveys of children and youth from Alberta, Nova Scotia, and Canada-wide. Two of these surveys were linked to standardized exam performance while the Canadian survey had students self-report their academic achievement. I found that adherence to established recommendations for a healthy diet, particularly for sugar intake, physical activity, screen usage, and sleep were positively and strongly associated with better academic achievement. Children who met recommendations for free sugar intake scored almost 4% better on their academic exams compared to children who did not. In Nova Scotian children, the combined effects of adhering to all of these guidelines had a stronger association with academic achievement than the whole of their individual effects. Students who met the highest number of healthy lifestyle behaviour recommendations had up to three times the odds of meeting expectations on their exams compared to children who met the lowest number. This thesis generated novel evidence to demonstrate that adherence to healthy lifestyle behaviour recommendations are strongly associated with better academic achievement in children and early adolescents, regardless of body weight status or soecioeconomic status. This thesis generates three key recommendations for public health. First, free sugars intake among children is a key health promotion target to both improve the health of children and improve their academic achievement. Based on my findings, if all children in Alberta met the recommendations for free sugars intake, 1.4% more students would meet the Acceptable Standard on standardized exams in Language Arts, and 0.3% more would meet it in Math. In addition, 0.5% more students would meet the Excellence Standard in both Language Arts and Math. Currently, Alberta Education is committed to increasing the number of children who meet each of these standards by 0.2% each year for the next three years. Working towards the reduction of free sugars intake of Albertan students would easily meet these institutional goals with added health benefit. Secondly, this thesis demonstrates the importance of the promotion and adherence to healthy lifestyle behaviour guidelines for children. I also recommend the inclusion of free sugars guidelines in the next version of CanadaM-bM-^@M-^Ys Food Guide to complement existing Canadian guidelines for diet, physical activity, sleep, and screen usage. Third, the evidence from this thesis demonstrates that school-based health promotion to improve the lifestyle behaviours of children will benefit the academic success of all children regardless of their socioeconomic or body weight status. I recommend the broader implementation and evaluation of effective school-based health promotion initiatives in Canada. In particular, further implementation of initiatives taking a Comprehensive School Health approach and rigorous evaluation of their impact on studentsM-bM-^@M-^Y academic achievement is merited given the compelling evidence generated by this thesis." ;

    ns5:abstract "Metastasis is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths, yet there are no therapies that directly target this process. To identify potential therapeutic targets of metastatic dissemination, we recently completed the first whole human genome shRNA screen using a novel avian embryo intravital imaging platform developed by our group. Nine genes not previously linked to metastasis were identified, including KIF3B, which we determined is required for both in vivo cell migration and metastasis of human cancer cells in avian embryo and mouse models.  KIF3B, a member of the kinesin family, is a (+)-end directed microtubule motor that targets the delivery of molecules from the cell interior to the cell periphery. Using an intravital imaging approach, we observed that cancer cells depleted of KIF3B form long cytoplasmic extensions but are unable to productively migrate. We hypothesized that this could be due to loss of key functions in focal adhesions and invadopodia, cellular structures that respectively link the actin cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix and mediate matrix degradation through enrichment of MT1-MMP. Here we show that KIF3B knockdown by siRNA did not alter the size or number of focal adhesions and did not reduce invadopodia-mediated matrix degradation or extravasation. To increase depletion of KIF3B, we created KIF3B CRISPR knockouts and show that KIF3B is required for motility of human fibrosarcoma (HT1080) cells in vivo and is required for the trafficking of MT1-MMP to the cell surface where it is active. Therefore, the lack of a phenotype in our molecular mechanism experiments may have been due to low levels of KIF3B knockdown achieved with siRNA. Additionally, we show that  targeting of KIF3B with custom-designed siRNA blocks human epidermoid carcinoma (HEp3) cell motility in vivo. Ultimately, continuation of this study may identify the molecular mechanisms of KIF3B in cancer cell migration and metastasis and lead to the development of specific anti-metastatic therapies." ;

    ns5:abstract "The recent development of stretchable electronics expands the scope of wearable and healthcare applications. This creates a high demand in stretchy conductor that can maintain conductivity at high strain conditions. Here, we describe a simple and novel fabrication way to achieve stretchable, 3Dprintable and lowcost conductive composite ink. It can be favorable in printing the complex stretchable patterns with high conductivity. Such elastic ink is composed of silver(Ag) flakes, fluorine rubber, an organic solvent and dispersive agent. The dispersive agent must be compatible with the chosen fluorine rubber as it accounts for multiple roles in the composite which promotes compatibility between silver flakes and fluorine rubber and also affects the mechanical properties of the hosting fluoropolymers as well as adhesion properties of the composite. Based on experimental observations in our work, we discuss the exact role of the dispersive agent in the composite. The resulting composite exhibits high conductivity value of 8.49 M-QM-^E104 S/m along with high reliability against repeated four stretching/releasing cycles. Interesting examples of transfer printing of the printed ink and its applications in working devices, such as conformal antennas and stretchable heater, are also showcased." ;

    ns1:abstract "Glycans play essential roles in the life cycle of bacteria and often modulate interactions with their environment. Chemical synthesis provides a useful tool to access structurally well-defined bacterial glycans. These molecules can serve as probes for elucidating the biological function of these glycans and can also be helpful tools in providing an understanding of their biosynthesis. This thesis is focused on the synthesis of three types of bacterial glycans: rhamnolipids, lipooligosaccharides and lipopolysaccharide biosynthetic intermediates.  In the first project, I focused on the synthesis of four rhamnolipid analogs. Rhamnolipids can modulate the immune response of hosts that they infect. However, the structural features in these molecules required for their immunomodulatory activity is not well understood. The molecules consist of one or more rhamnose residues linked to an ester-containing lipid. Because the ester functionality is relatively unstable in biological systems, I was interested in making analogs in which this functionality was replaced with more stable species as they may have better biological activities due to longer survival times. In this study, I synthesized amide, ketone, ether and hydrocarbon rhamnolipid derivatives.  In the second project, a convergent strategy was developed for the stereoselective synthesis of four unusual N-acylated monosaccharides, which are fragments of lipooligosacchride IV (LOS IV) from Mycobacterium marinum. A critical substrate-controlled cyclization of an amino acid derived oxazolidine was the key step for synthesis of three of the targets. The fourth target was assembled from 3-butynol; the key step was a one-pot oxidationM-bM-^@M-^ScyclizationM-bM-^@M-^Soxidation of a Boc-protected amino alcohol that led to the formation of lactam. This work represents the first synthesis of these unusual motifs, which have been shown to be essential to the bioactivity of LOS IV. In Chapter 4, I synthesized large, lipid-linked glycans related to lipopolysaccharide biosynthetic intermediates in Escherichia coli O9a. Our targets are structures that contain from 2, 6, 10, 14 or 18 tetrasaccharide repeating units, linked through a pyrophosphate moiety to farnesol. The approach I developed involves assembly of the carbohydrate chain, formation of a glycosyl phosphate intermediate, coupling with a lipid phosphate and finally deprotection. Using this approach, I successfully synthesized targets with two and six repeating units, containing 11 and 27 monosaccharide residues, respectively." ;

    ns2:abstract "Stimuli-responsive polymers have found their way into numerous materials and devices for myriad applications that can solve problems related to human health and the environment. In this dissertation, the work covers the general scope of stimuli-responsive polymers, with a special focus on thermo-responsive poly (N-isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAm)-based microgels and their co-functional composites, and their applications in controlled drug delivery. Chapter 1 gives a brief introduction about stimuli-responsive polymers and Chapter 2 discusses the applications of stimuli-responsive polymers in controlled drug delivery. In Chapter 3, the study of rate control, by varying the thickness of a membrane (device Au layer) was shown to control the rate of release from the device. With the increase of Au layer thickness, the drug release rate is able to slow down and the release could be triggered by temperature and pH. After that, the modification of the devices membrane layer was investigated for its ability to control the release behavior (Chapter 4). Subsequently, a multi-drug releasing system was developed by incorporating two different microgels, which has the ability to sequential release drugs by changing the pH (Chapter 5). Free-standing assemblies of microgels were then generated by simply applying a sacrificial layer under the film and this film was transferable to other substrates, whether flat or curve surface, and even human skin (Chapter 6). In Chapter 7, the optical properties and drug releasing behavior were studied on this developed device by light-induced pH change, which makes this platform versatile for developing smart systems based on other stimuli. Furthermore, by tuning the chemistry of microgels, we were able to generate microgel-based aggregates for drug delivery applications from microgels with opposite charges (Chapter 8). In Chapter 9, novel microgels from supramolecular crosslinker were firstly prepared with the degradable properties. The characterizations of this microgel promote it as a great candidate for degradable drug delivery system. Finally, in Chapter 10, conclusion and future outlook are presented to illustrate the future direction of this research topic." ;

    ns1:subject "Monolayer cryopreservation",
        "human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs)" ;
    ns4:abstract "Cryopreservation is a process by which biological materials (cells and tissues) are cooled down to cryogenic temperatures (such as the temperature of liquid nitrogen M-bM-^@M-^S196 M-BM-0C), are maintained at this temperature for a long period of time and then thawed to resume their normal functions [1]. At cryogenic temperature, all biological and chemical activities are stopped [1], [4], [15] allowing very long storage times. In order to minimize damage due to cryoinjury, the use of cryoprotectants (CPAs) in cryopreservation solutions was developed [24], [25], [26]. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and hydroxyethyl starch (HES) are two examples of penetrating and non-penetrating cryoprotectants respectively.  In contrast to cell cryopreservation in suspension, cryopreservation of cells in a monolayer, a two-dimensional structure of closely packed cells attached to a substrate, has always been challenging and the cryopreservation protocol for cells in suspension is generally not applicable to cells in monolayers. Cryopreservation of monolayers of cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) are of interest as a model for cryopreservation of intact endothelial monolayers that cover the inner surface of blood vessels and also as a model for corneal endothelium. In this thesis, cryopreservation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in monolayers was studied leading to development of a protocol for cryopreservation of HUVECs in monolayers.  For this purpose, several different factors had to be considered. This study showed that the substrate affects viability of HUVECs in cryopreservation. The best cryoprotectant solution for HUVECs in monolayer was a combination of 5% DMSO, 6% HES and 2% chondroitin sulfate. A lower cooling rate of 0.2 M-BM-0C/min compared with 1 M-BM-0C/min resulted in higher viability for plunge-thaw samples for all experimental temperatures. While CPA removal is common after thawing, this study showed that CPA removal 24 hours after thaw resulted in higher viability for HUVECs compared with CPA removal immediately after thaw. This study showed that the highest viability after cryopreservation of HUVEC monolayers was achieved for cells cultured on Rinzl coverslips for 7 days, cooled at a rate of 0.2 M-BM-0C/min in the presence of 5% DMSO, 6% HES and 2% chondroitin sulfate, plunged into liquid nitrogen from  M-bM-^@M-^S45 M-BM-0C and the CPA removal 24 hours after thawing. The relative and absolute viabilities for this protocol were 81.7 M-BM-1 9.1% and 70.7 M-BM-1 8.9% respectively. These cells can be used as a model for cryopreservation of intact monolayers that cover the inner surface of blood vessels and also as a model for corneal endothelium." ;

    ns1:abstract "The nucleus is a hallmark of eukaryotic cells. It segregates the genetic material from the cytoplasm. The nucleus is encapsulated by the nuclear envelope which is perforated with nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), macromolecular structures formed by proteins termed nucleoporins (Nups). NPCs and nuclear transport factors regulate nucleocytoplasmic transport. Many Nups also function away from NPCs, within the nucleoplasm, where they associate with chromatin and other nuclear factors to regulate gene expression and RNA metabolism.  One such Nup, Nup98, has been shown to interact with chromatin to regulate gene expression in metazoan cells. To gain further insight into how Nup98 contributes to gene expression regulation in human cells, we began by identifying novel Nup98 binding partners and focusing on those with known roles in gene expression. Here, we report the identification of DHX9, a DExH/D-box helicase, as an intranuclear Nup98 binding partner. Our results show that the N-terminal domain of Nup98, containing FG/GLFG amino-acid repeats, binds to DHX9 in an RNA-facilitated manner. DHX9 interacts with Nup98 via its N- and C-terminal domains, which bind double-stranded and single-stranded RNAs, respectively. Importantly, the RNA-dependent ATPase activity of DHX9 is stimulated by its interaction with Nup98, resulting in increased DHX9-stimulated transcription of a reporter gene. Consistent with these observations, Nup98 and DHX9 bind interdependently to similar gene loci and their transcripts, regulating gene expression and RNA splicing. Based on our results, we propose that Nup98 affects gene expression and RNA metabolism by functioning as a cofactor that regulates DHX9 and, potentially, other RNA helicases in the cell.  Several viruses exploit Nups and RNA helicases during infection. Nup98 and DHX9 are among these host factors hijacked by viruses to participate in their life cycle. Thus, we explored how the Nup98-DHX9 complex, characterized as a regulator of gene expression and RNA metabolism in the host cell, can be exploited by positive-strand RNA viruses of the Flaviviridae family (i.e. the Hepatitis C virus and Zika virus). We also examined the importance of other host RNA-binding nuclear factors and nuclear transport factors (NTFs) in the life cycle of these cytoplasmic RNA viruses. Despite the cytoplasmic replication cycle of the Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and Zika virus (ZIKV), their positive-strand RNA genomes (+vRNA) are present in the nuclei of infected cells. NTFs dynamically transport this nuclear pool of +vRNA, and altering nucleocytoplasmic transport can affect the nuclear localization of the viral genome in infected cells. Disrupting the nuclear localization of +vRNA changes its interaction with several RNA-binding host nuclear factors (including Nup98 and DHX9), consequently affecting the viral life cycle. These data point towards a previously unknown role for the nuclear environment in the life cycle of viruses that undergo replication in the cytoplasm of the host cells." ;

    ns1:abstract "The work in this thesis describes the stabilization of reactive and elusive main group entities with the aid of Wittig reagents, transition metal complexes, or N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) as donors. Wittig reagents were employed to stabilize various group 14 element dihydrides (EH2; E = Ge and Sn) within donor-acceptor complexes. Furthermore, traditional hot injection or microwave assisted heating of a GeH2 donor-acceptor complex yielded surface functionalized Ge nanoparticles. Donor-acceptor complexes of unsaturated mixed group 13/15 hydrides (HB=NH) were also synthesized via Lewis acid-assisted N2 elimination followed by H- migration from B to N within carbene-bound azidoborane precursors. The reactivity of such HB=NH complexes was studied in detail including attempts to convert these species into bulk BN.  Parallel chemistry with Ga was explored in an attempt to prepare a donor-acceptor complex of HGa=NH; however the high reactivity of the Ga-H bonds in the precursor azidogallane complex NHCM-bM-^@M-"GaH2N3 did not permit the isolation of such species. In addition, donor-acceptor complexes of chlorooxoborane (ClBO) featuring very short B=O bonds have been synthesized. These species are found to be active reagents for alkane C-F bond activation and functionalization." ;

    ns4:abstract "Glycans play essential roles in the life cycle of bacteria and often modulate interactions with their environment. Chemical synthesis provides a useful tool to access structurally well-defined bacterial glycans. These molecules can serve as probes for elucidating the biological function of these glycans and can also be helpful tools in providing an understanding of their biosynthesis. This thesis is focused on the synthesis of three types of bacterial glycans: rhamnolipids, lipooligosaccharides and lipopolysaccharide biosynthetic intermediates.  In the first project, I focused on the synthesis of four rhamnolipid analogs. Rhamnolipids can modulate the immune response of hosts that they infect. However, the structural features in these molecules required for their immunomodulatory activity is not well understood. The molecules consist of one or more rhamnose residues linked to an ester-containing lipid. Because the ester functionality is relatively unstable in biological systems, I was interested in making analogs in which this functionality was replaced with more stable species as they may have better biological activities due to longer survival times. In this study, I synthesized amide, ketone, ether and hydrocarbon rhamnolipid derivatives.  In the second project, a convergent strategy was developed for the stereoselective synthesis of four unusual N-acylated monosaccharides, which are fragments of lipooligosacchride IV (LOS IV) from Mycobacterium marinum. A critical substrate-controlled cyclization of an amino acid derived oxazolidine was the key step for synthesis of three of the targets. The fourth target was assembled from 3-butynol; the key step was a one-pot oxidationM-bM-^@M-^ScyclizationM-bM-^@M-^Soxidation of a Boc-protected amino alcohol that led to the formation of lactam. This work represents the first synthesis of these unusual motifs, which have been shown to be essential to the bioactivity of LOS IV. In Chapter 4, I synthesized large, lipid-linked glycans related to lipopolysaccharide biosynthetic intermediates in Escherichia coli O9a. Our targets are structures that contain from 2, 6, 10, 14 or 18 tetrasaccharide repeating units, linked through a pyrophosphate moiety to farnesol. The approach I developed involves assembly of the carbohydrate chain, formation of a glycosyl phosphate intermediate, coupling with a lipid phosphate and finally deprotection. Using this approach, I successfully synthesized targets with two and six repeating units, containing 11 and 27 monosaccharide residues, respectively." ;

    ns3:abstract "Applications using big data and machine learning techniques are transforming how people live in the 21st century, however they are generally underutilized in public health compared to other domains. We proposed and conducted two independent studies to investigate how big data and machine learning techniques may serve important functions to address different public health challenges in North America.  In Name- and Location-based Aboriginal Ethnicity Classification, we developed and tested the classification performance of a machine learning method to predict individualsM-bM-^@M-^Y Aboriginal status using name and location information from the 1901 Canadian census. Our automated approach has yielded good classification results, especially for a number of Aboriginal (all-inclusive) and sub-Aboriginal (such as First Nations, Algonquian, and Kootenay) statuses. The classification performance for predicting ethnicity status of these four Aboriginal groupings ranged between 0.99-1.00 in accuracy, 0.99-1.00 in ROC, 0.63-0.65 in sensitivity, 0.99-1.00 in specificity, 0.78-0.86 in PPV, and 0.99-1.00 in NPV in the validation sets. The demonstrated application illustrated that using high decision boundary values resulted in predicted First Nations-specific prevalence statistics closely approximated to the true underlying prevalence.  In Sentiment Analysis of Breast Cancer Screening in the United States Using Twitter, we slightly modified the existing VADER sentiment classifier to automatically classify the sentiment of breast cancer screening-related tweets into neutral, positive, and negative. Extensive data visualization was conducted to illustrate the temporal (via time-series plot), geospatial (via point, hot spot, and quintile maps), and thematic (via word-clouds) patterns of breast cancer screening sentiment in the U.S. The ecological associations between the averaged sentiment scores and percentage of breast cancer screening uptake at the state level were examined, and significant inverse relationships (p<0.05) were found between negative sentiments and recent uptakes of mammogram and clinical breast exam." ;

        "Solid Organ Transplant" ;
    ns4:abstract "Cytomegalovirus (CMV), a herpes-virus, is widespread in the human population as a lifelong and largely asymptomatic infection in immunocompetent people, but it is a major cause of morbidity in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients. Knowledge of pre-transplant CMV infection status, generally determined using serology to detect IgG antibodies to CMV, is critical in stratifying the risk of CMV disease post-transplant and affects decisions regarding the use of anti-viral prophylaxis and enhanced surveillance including additional laboratory testing for CMV disease post-transplant. Unfortunately, serology-based determination of CMV infection status has limitations in situations where passive antibodies may lead to falsely positive CMV serology, such as in young infants who may have maternal antibody and in individuals who have received a recent transfusion of plasma-containing blood products. While guidelines suggest that CMV serology may be unreliable in infants less than 12 or 18 months of age, the time to clearance of passive maternal CMV IgG is not well established.  Our first objective with this program of research was to gain insight into the age of clearance of passive maternal CMV IgG in infants to aid in identification of the group of infants in whom CMV serology may be unreliable due to passive maternal antibody. This was accomplished with a retrospective review of pre-transplant CMV serology and viral detection studies for all infants <18 months of age awaiting solid organ transplant at the Stollery ChildrenM-bM-^@M-^Ys Hospital over a 20 year period. The results suggested that maternal CMV IgG was cleared before 12 months of age, thus supporting that 12 months, as opposed to 18 months, may be a more appropriate cut-off for considering CMV serology potentially unreliable due to passive maternal antibody. Our second objective was to evaluate the use of novel assays, not affected by potential passive antibody, to more accurately assign CMV infection status in adults and children awaiting SOT, especially in those whose true CMV infection status may be obscured by potential passive antibody. In our first study, we evaluated our experience with the use of CMV culture and nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) to detect CMV shedding, a marker of true CMV infection, in young infants with potential passive antibody awaiting SOT. In our second study, we prospectively evaluated the use of CMV NAAT as well as the detection of CMV-specific CD4+ T cells by flow-cytometry, and the CD27-CD28- CD4+T cell phenotype as adjuncts to CMV serology in the assignment of CMV infection status in adults and children awaiting solid organ transplant. Our results clearly highlight that CMV NAAT, from urine and saliva or throat samples, is a useful adjunct to CMV serology in CMV seropositive infants with potential passive antibody as it confirms true positive CMV infection status in a significant number of infants. Detection of CMV-specific CD4+ T cells showed promise as an adjunct to CMV serology in pre-transplant CMV risk stratification in children >12 months of age and in adults but lacked sensitivity in identifying true positive CMV infection status in young infants (<12 months). T cell phenotype analysis for CD27-CD28- CD4+T cells is unlikely to be a valuable tool in establishing true CMV infection status in children but may have a role in clarifying true pre-transplant CMV infection status in adults with unreliable CMV serology. Taken together our studies support that CMV NAAT, of urine and saliva or throat swab, should be implemented for routine pre-transplant screening of CMV seropositive infants less than 12 months of age and could be considered in older children who have been transfused and have no pre-transfusion sample available. Detection of CMV-specific CD4+ T cells showed promise as an adjunct to CMV serology in determining true CMV infection status in adults and children >12 months of age with potential passive antibody but further evaluation, with larger numbers of pre-SOT subjects, is needed. However, detection of CMV-specific CD4+ T cells should not be used in isolation to determine CMV infection status in CMV seropositive infants < 12 months with potential passive antibody." ;

    ns3:abstract "Tropomyosin receptor kinases TrkA/B/C family supports neuronal growth, survival and differentiation during development, adult life and ageing. Downregulation of TrkA/B/C is a prominent hallmark of numerous neurological disorders including Alzheimer disease (AD). Abnormally expressed or overexpressed full length or fusion TrkA/B/C proteins which bear oncogenic potential and were shown to drive tumorigenesis in a variety of neurogenic and non-neurogenic human cancers are currently the focus of intensive clinical research. The study, both in oncology and neurology, of the spatiotemporal alterations in TrkA/B/C expression and density or the determination of target engagement of emerging antineoplastic kinase inhibitor drugs with those receptors in normal and diseased tissue is crucially needed but has however remained largely unexplored due to the lack of suitable non-destructive analytic tools. Here, we aim to develop and provide multi-species validation of carbon-11- and fluorine-18-labeled positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracers based on purposely designed small molecule kinase catalytic domain-binding inhibitors of TrkA/B/C.  We first demonstrate that pan-Trk selective inhibitor scaffolds which target both the active DFG-in and inactive DFG-out kinase conformations can be rationally modified to yield suitable compounds for translation into PET radiotracers.  In particular, the carbon-11 isotopologue of the preclinical 4-aza-2oxindole lead GW441756 is characterized as the first brain penetrant Trk radiotracer based on rodent PET experiments in vivo. Using human neuroblastoma tissue, it is also shown that type-I pan-Trk-selective radiotracers, including [11C]GW441756, enable tumor visualization selectivity, based on TrkB status in vitro.  Subsequently, we show that impediments associated with the development of orthosteric tracers for intracellular in vivo neuroimaging of protein kinases can be addressed via thorough structure-activity relationship (SAR) screening such as generating a lead suitable for human use. From the screening of an imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazine-based pan-Trk inhibitors library, followed by the in vivo assessment of multiple radiotracers from this series, we provide the detailed evaluation of [11C]-(R)-IPMICF16 as the first TrkB/C-targeted lead radiotracer with suitable properties for neuroimaging in human. The evaluation presented includes PET imaging studies in four species from mice to first-in-human as well as Trk kinase inhibitor target engagement confirmation using the phase II clinical inhibitor entrectinib in mice. Relying on extensive human kinome analyses, we also show that (R)-IPMICF16 constitutes both the most potent and most selective TrkB/C inhibitor known to date. We furthermore demonstrate that this lead efficiently enables the discrimination of AD versus healthy control brains based on hippocampal binding in human in vitro. We present additional efforts in our exploration of Trk radiotracers with the development of an 18F-labeled quinazoline-based pan-Trk lead which displays suitable properties for in vivo translation and favorable Trk activities, including towards clinically relevant Trk oncogenic drivers such as TrkA-TPM3. Finally, current work in the second generation optimization of our [11C]-(R)-IPMICF16 clinical lead is described. Of interest, it is shown that a state-of-art copper-mediated 18F-fluorination technique can be used to secure the inactivated 18F-arene moiety of our new lead tracer, [18F]-(R)-IPMICF17.  The Trk-targeted probes delineated here represent a novel class of molecular imaging radiotracers for the non-invasive and in-depth interrogation study of signal transduction at the interface of oncology and neurology. Globally, the results presented entail the further exploration of Trk radiotracers as a novel tool for the study and diagnosis of human neurodegenerative diseases and patients identification in the context of personalized oncology." ;

        "Silicon" ;
    ns2:abstract "The elements of Group 14 show an extensive range of chemical behaviors. Lying at the boundary between metals and non-metals, some members of Group 14, namely silicon and germanium, are intermediate in their properties. These semiconductors are extremely important in science and technology. Si, Ge, SixGe1-x, and corresponding compounds (e.g., oxides and carbides) hold potential for far-reaching modern impacts and numerous optoelectronic applications. The discovery of size-dependent optical responses from nanostructures of these semiconductors has opened new avenues for further studies and enhanced their potential for various uses. Although Si-based nanostructures (e.g., Si nanocrystals and porous-Si) have been widely studied, Ge-based nanostructures have received significantly less attention, presumably because of their complex chemistry and the lack of convenient/predictable methods for their preparation.  In this context, germanium dioxide nanoparticles (GeO2 NPs) of varied sizes and morphologies were prepared via facile sol-gel synthesis without the addition of surfactant (Chapter two). Morphology control was readily achieved by tailoring the water/ethanol ratio in the reaction mixture. Through judicious tailoring of reaction parameters, surfactant-free crystalline GeO2 nano-cubes and nano-eggs exhibiting currently unparalleled narrow size distributions were obtained. After that, tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) based sol-gel reactions were used to form a robust shell of StM-CM-6ber SiO2 around previously prepared GeO2 NPs and form GeO2@SiO2 core-shell nano-cubes or nano-eggs (Chapter three). Subsequently, the core and the shell of these NPs were selectively reduced by 5% H2/95% Ar and elemental magnesium to yield Ge@SiO2 and Ge@Si core-shell NPs, respectively. In the fourth and fifth chapters, we turned our attention to the synthesis of germanium nanocrystals (GeNCs) with well-defined surface chemistry. This research area is of considerable interest because of the attractive optoelectronic properties of GeNCs with sizes smaller than the germanium Bohr-exciton radius (i.e., <24 nm). In the Chapter four, we reported a straight-forward route for synthesizing GeNCs in high-yield and also clarified some chemistry regarding the Ge (II) precursor. Both the precursor and procedure were modified to yield GeNCs of various morphologies. Modifying and tailoring GeNC surface chemistry was the subject of the fifth Chapter, due to the important role of surface functionalization in solubility and stability of GeNCs. In this context, hydride-terminated GeNCs (H-GeNCs) were freed from their germania matrices by chemical etching of the GeNC/GeO2 composite and were then derivatized using a series of hydrogermylation approaches (i.e., thermally-activated, radical-initiated, and borane-catalyzed). We found that surface functionalization occurred under all conditions investigated; however, the nature of the surface species (i.e., monolayers vs. multilayers) and surface coverage varied depending on the conditions employed.  Application of functionalized NCs is the subject of sixth Chapter. The nanostructures of Group 14 semiconductors are well suited for use in biological systems due to their biocompatibility and fairly low toxicity compared to typical quantum dots such as CdSe. The size/surface dependent optical response of Si nanocrystals (SiNCs) is well-known and more developed than GeNCs. Therefore, we chose acid-functionalized SiNCs as the pioneer for making nano-hybrids with Fe3O4 NPs. We demonstrated proof-of-concept confocal cell imaging using these magnetic nano-hybrids. Finally, Chapter seven summarises what has been achieved for each Chapter of current Thesis. The aim of this Chapter is to provide a summary for synthesize and surface functionalization of Group 14 semiconductors nanomaterials and outline some possible future direction for continuing this Thesis." ;

    ns5:abstract "Transplant tourism, a term used to describe travelling for transplantation if it involves practices such as organ commercialization, organ trafficking and the neglect of the transplant needs of individuals in the destination/transplant State, is currently a global concern. Accounting for about 10% of all transplants globally, the negative effects of transplant tourism as evidenced in the lives of persons and societies all over the world have been well documented. Surprisingly, transplant tourism is currently not directly prohibited by international law and prohibited in only 5 States. Most of the international law instruments which presently have transplant tourism as their sole focus are unenforceable soft law instruments such as resolutions of the World Health Assembly and the Declaration of Istanbul on Organ Trafficking and Transplant Tourism.  In an effort to address the harm brought about by transplant tourism and the dearth of laws for the prohibition of the practices in international and national legal systems, this dissertation, by carrying out extensive and inter-disciplinary research, explores the role that international and national laws must play in the prohibition and eradication of transplant tourism and proposes a legal model for the prohibition of transplant tourism. Through the examination of international law norms, principles and instruments; laws and policies from several legal systems; and legal frameworks and models which currently prohibit a number of national, transnational and international offences, this dissertation has developed a three-stage legal model which can be used to prohibit transplant tourism practices. They are: (1) the development of a comprehensive soft law instrument on transplant tourism which would influence future binding national and international law instruments for the prohibition of transplant tourism; (2) the creation of a treaty on transplant tourism under the auspices of the United Nations, preferably, as an additional protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; and (3) the creation of unified national transplant tourism laws with extraterritorial application in accordance with the principles and spirit of the international law instruments. This dissertation also explores the important roles that Transnational Advocacy Networks and the current epistemic community focusing on transplant tourism play in the move towards the global prohibition of transplant tourism." ;

    ns1:abstract "Cattle shedding > 104 CFU E. coli O157/gram of feces are defined as super-shedder (SS) which are a major disseminator of this foodborne pathogen into the environment. The recto-anal junction (RAJ) has been identified as the primary colonization site of E. coli O157within the gastrointestinal tract. To date, the mechanisms of E. coli O157 super-shedding in beef cattle remain unidentified. This thesis aimed to identify host mechanisms that are potentially associated with super-shedding through performing four studies on host gene expression throughout the intestinal tract and associated regulation mechanisms. Study 1 performed comparative transcriptomic analysis of rectal tissue collected from 5 SS and 4 cattle free from fecal E. coli O157 (non-shedders, NS) using RNA-Seq, and identified 58 differentially expressed (DE) genes including 11 that were up-regulated and 47 that were down-regulated in SS compared to NS. Functional analysis of these DE genes revealed that 31 down-regulated genes were potentially associated with reduced innate and adaptive immunity including decreased quantity and migration of immune cells such as lymphocytes, neutrophils and dendritic cells in SS. This suggests that the RAJ of SS may be less effective in terms of immune protection. Study 2 performed RNA-Seq to characterize and compare the transcriptomes of the whole intestinal tissues of SS and NS to understand whether other gut regions could also be associated with super shedding. In total, 351 DE genes were identified throughout the gastrointestinal tract between SS and NS, with 101 being up-regulated and 250 down-regulated in SS. Functional analysis of these DE genes suggested increased T-cell responses and cholesterol absorption in the distal jejunum and descending colon, and decreased B-cell maturation in the distal jejunum of SS. Further, single nucleotide polymorphism analysis of these DE genes identified association between 33 SNPs in 7 DE genes and E. coli O157 shedding. The functions of these 7 genes were associated with leukocyte activation and cholesterol transportation, suggesting that host genetic variation may influence gene expression leading to altered immune functions and cholesterol transportation in SS. Study 3 analyzed miRNAomes of the whole intestinal tract of SS and NS, aiming to identify the possible post transcriptional regulatory mechanisms that altered gene expression observed in studies 1 and 2. In total, the number of DE miRNAs ranged from 1 (in descending colon) to 8 (in distal jejunum) and 7 miRNAs were up-regulated and 7 were down-regulated throughout the gut of SS. Functional analysis indicated that the DE miRNAs potentially regulate genes involved in host immune function including hematological system development and immune cell trafficking. These findings suggest that the alternation of miRNA expression may be one of the regulatory mechanisms responsible for the altered expression of genes associated with immune function in the gut of SS. In study 4, bacterial 16S rRNA gene amplicon profiling was performed to characterize the RAJ mucosa associated microbiota and their functions (using PICRUSt). Differential abundance analysis of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) identified 2 OTUs unique to SS which potentially represented members Bacteroides and Clostridium, and 7 OTUs unique to NS which potentially represented members of Coprococcus, Prevotella, Clostridium and Paludibacter. The relative abundance of microbial taxa and their function were correlated with the DE genes of RAJ reported in study 2, with results suggesting that Clostridium, Coprococcus and Paludibacter may alter the host host epithelium in a manner that deters the colonization of the RAJ by E. coli O157. In summary, this thesis provides knowledge of the host gut gene expression, miRNA regulation, and host-microbial interaction in beef cattle that differ in their E. coli O157 shedding capacity. Our findings suggest that E. coli O157 shedding in cattle could be systematically attributed to differences in host immune responses, genetic variation, miRNA regulation, and the nature of the gut microbiota." ;

    ns7:abstract "Background: The trigeminal ganglion (TG) is a cluster of neuron bodies in the cranium that supplies the face and skull with sensory innervation. In the mouse, neurons of the TG supply the whisker pad that is important for spatial navigation and intraspecific communication. Specialized cells in the TG can detect tactile stimuli, positional stimuli, and pain. The origin of these neurons is thought to be the neural crest and the neuroectoderm. Previous studies have established that early neurogenesis requires the activation of neurogenin 1 and 2 (Ngn1/2), early growth response protein 2 (Egr2) and brain-specific homeobox protein 3a (Brn3a) to specify neural crest cells to sensory neurons. Subsequently, nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and neurotrophins 3 and 4 (NT3/NT4), produced by target tissues, are required for nerve subtype specification, target innervation, and survival. Recently, bone morphogenetic proteins (Bmps) have been implicated to participate in these processes by retrograde signaling. Bmps are secreted peptides that are important for cell survival, differentiation, and homeostasis. Currently, it is not known which or how Bmps regulate sensory nerve development. Here we demonstrate an altered sensory phenotype in mice carrying a complete and neural crest-specific (Wnt1-cre) deletion of Bmp7.  Methods: Embryos were harvested from mice carrying either a complete deletion (Bmp7M-bM-^HM-^F/M-bM-^HM-^F) or a conditional deletion of Bmp7 in the neural crest (Bmp7fl/fl Wnt1-cre) and characterized using histological, immunohistochemical, and gene expression analysis (qPCR) of various sensory neuronal receptors, peptides, and transcription factors (TrkA, TrpV1, CGRP, Runx1, Ret for nociceptive  neurons; TrkB, TrkC, Runx3, Ret for mechano-and proprioceptive neurons). The whisker pads of adult mice carrying a neural crest-specific deletion of Bmp7 were tested with a 15 psi air puff current to determine whether molecular differences result in physiological changes.  Results: The trigeminal ganglion in embryos carrying a full and conditional deletion of Bmp7 is morphologically altered, appearing to be smaller and slightly misshapen in comparison to wild-type littermates. In addition, qPCR analysis shows mRNA differences in some receptors, pain associated peptides, and transcription factors (TrkA, Trpv1, Ret, CGRP, Runx1), indicative of an increased nociceptor phenotype or a delay in neuronal development. At 15psi air pressures, conditional knockout mice were less mechanosensitive and more pain sensitive.  Conclusion: Bmp7 is important for peripheral nerve development. Gene expression analysis reveals that sensory neurons of mutants may have an increased nociceptor phenotype or may be delayed in development. Immunohistochemical analyses established that the TGs are smaller and misshapen in mutants. Air puff assays indicate that Wnt1-cre mutants have an inhibited mechano-response, but a hyperalgesic response. Future experiments will elucidate the mechanisms by which these changes occur." ;

        "trauma literature" ;
    ns2:abstract "Once limited to clinical psychology, trauma, broadly defined as a disruptive pain, an extraordinary malaise that may leave an indelible mark on oneM-bM-^@M-^Ys memory, has been extended in the past decades to describe abruptly horrific experiences on the communal level. Wars, revolutions, genocides, or large scale calamities of any kind that sweep the social sphere without giving it a chance to adapt or resist, are considered traumas. Since the rise of academic studies of the Holocaust, the prevalence of trauma studies has continuously grown. A line of inquiry, however, that is not yet fully investigated in trauma studies is the issue of narrativization. The essential question of this project is how emplotmentM-bM-^@M-^Ti.e., arranging experiences into a coherent plotM-bM-^@M-^Trenders horrific memories comprehensible. In other words, the question is how narration engenders trauma out of mnemonic fragments. To this end, the project offers an original tripartite paradigm of trauma emplotment. The three stages of this paradigm, each defined as a dialectical opposition of two narrative trajectories, are named comic-tragic, inclusive-exclusive, and universal-unique. Collectively, they illustrate the process through which convoluted, and sometimes incongruous, memories of extraordinary hardship and horror are aligned into an understandable whole. Using this composite framework, I examine three distinct, but interrelated, national cases of traumatic histories in Iran, Palestine, and the United States. In the chapter dedicated to the Iranian pro-government literature of the 1980-88 war against Iraq, the hegemonic discourse of war, known as the Sacred Defense (defa-e moghaddas), is studied. Four representative literary works are analyzed to unearth the narrative that supports an apologetic account of war, appropriating the raw material of iii traumatic memories to consolidate an Islamic revolutionary nationalism, particularly one that is bolstered through a historical antagonism against the American foreign policy. The next chapter, examining Palestinian literature after the Oslo Accords (1993-95), grapples with a problem from a different direction: in the absence of any national sovereignty, it asks how memories of dispossession and displacement are organized, to what collective identity they contribute, and how several generations of traumatic memories are prioritized to construct a narrative whole. This chapter analyzes the fragmented experiences of a nation under constant threat of extinction, whose commemoration of historic traumas is both thwarted and intensified by the ceaseless unfolding of new traumatic experiences. Studying the American literature of the two post-9/11 wars in Afghanistan and Iraq complements, and complicates, the topics covered in the two previous chapters. In the case of literary works by American veterans, mostly personal war experiences thinly shrouded in fiction, the issues of nationalism and public memories of war are explored by turning the tables, as it were, to examine the trauma of the traumatizers. This chapter focuses on the reveries of empathy with oneM-bM-^@M-^Ys purported national enemy and the moral dilemmas, which exacerbate the traumatic experience. With all their different political trajectories, the representative texts in these three national cases use common narrative strategies to construct unified stories, resolving innate problems of memorialization in order to present indelible pains. Each of these literary constellations applies the same narrative paradigms of trauma emplotment, but generates entirely different artefacts. My project articulates, in sum, how narrative processes move from painful experiences to political statements." ;

    ns1:abstract "Development of the vertebrate ocular structures requires the cooperative interactions of transcription factors, signalling proteins, external growth factors, and epigenetic regulatory factors. Consequently, misregulation of these cues can result in a number of developmental and functional defects. We were interested in the roles of the distal-less homeobox transcription factors (Dlx) Dlx1 and Dlx2, and the transmembrane receptor neuropilin-2 (Nrp2) in the development of the vertebrate retina and ocular vasculature. In the retina, Dlx genes are known to be involved in the differentiation of retinal ganglion cells (RGC) by transactivating expression of genes required for both differentiation and survival of RGC. The role of Nrp2 in the developing retina, on the other hand, is unknown.   In addition to defects in RGC differentiation and survival in Dlx1/Dlx2 double knockout (DKO) retinas, an increase in expression of a critical photoreceptor gene, Crx has been reported. This led us to hypothesize that Dlx genes are required to make binary cell fate decisions between RGC and photoreceptors through transcriptional repression of genes critical for photoreceptor development, including the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor Olig2. We identified Olig2 as a transcriptional target of DLX2 both in vivo and in vitro. We determined that Olig2 expression is limited to photoreceptor precursors and excluded from mature photoreceptors.  Utilizing Dlx1/Dlx2 DKO animals we observed strain-dependent ectopic expression of OLIG2 in the ganglion cell layer (GCL). We suggest that Dlx1/Dlx2 expression is required for retinal progenitors to adopt an RGC fate and restrict the specification of photoreceptor cell fate. We also carried out studies of the role of Dlx1/Dlx2 in neuronal differentiation in the developing forebrain, which provided further insight into the mechanisms by which Dlx genes regulate differentiation in the central nervous system (CNS).  Nrp2 is widely known for its role in axonal guidance in the CNS. Neuropilins have also been shown to be critical for both developmental and pathological angiogenesis. However, the function of Nrp2 in the developing retina has not been previously explored. We postulated that Nrp2 would also be critical for developmental angiogenesis and axonal guidance during ocular development. Nrp2 expression was observed in the choroid and hyaloid vessels starting at early retinal development and in the RGC during later developmental stages. We observed increased expression of amacrine cell markers in the embryonic and adult Nrp2 knockout eye, resulting in an expanded inner plexiform layer (IPL) in postnatal stages of retinal development. In addition, the hyaloid vasculature persisted into much later developmental stages when compared with wildtype (WT) littermate controls, which is reminiscent of the human ocular disease known as persistent fetal vasculature (PFV). In addition, the Nrp2 null mice had a number of secondary ocular pathologies that are concurrent with PFV including retinal folding and microphthalmia. Our results indicated that Nrp2 plays a critical role in both transient embryonic vascular development and amacrine cell genesis in the developing retina.  Collectively, we found that both Dlx1/Dlx2 and Nrp2 have critical roles in the development of early-born cells of the inner retina including RGC and amacrine cells, respectively. In addition, we discovered a novel role for Nrp2 in hyaloid vasculature development. Future work clarifying the functional consequence of PFV and IPL expansion in the Nrp2 knockout eye will be of great interest, as will the role of Dlx genes in postnatal retina development." ;

        "N-myristoyltransferase" ;
    ns2:abstract "Myristoylation is the post-translational modification of proteins with a 14-carbon fatty- acid by N-myristoyltransferase 1 (NMT1) or NMT2. Myristoylation is key to protein membrane binding and cell survival. Bioinformatics data suggests NMT mRNA expression impacts overall survival (OS) in AML. We characterized NMT protein levels in AML patients. We performed a retrospective and prospective cohort study, including adult patients newly diagnosed with AML in Edmonton from April 2014 until September 2016, excluding acute promyelocytic leukemia. In addition, a small group of control marrow aspirates were obtained. We assayed marrow aspirate or peripheral blood for NMT1/2 protein levels by fluorescence activated cell sorting with intracytoplasmic staining by custom mouse anti-NMT1- Alexa-Fluor-647 or anti-NMT2-FITC, expressed as Mean Fluorescent Intensity (MFI) relative to IgG1k isotype control. NMT1/2 MFI was determined for the bulk blast, CD34+, and CD34+38- blast subpopulations. Clinical data was analysed by t-test or ANOVA. Relapse-free survival (RFS) and OS were dichotomized with a receiver operator curve, followed by a Kaplan-Meier analysis with a log-rank test for significance or univariate and multivariate Cox regression, with p < 0.05 as significant. Censoring, survival, and clinical parameters were defined by European LeukemiaNet (ELN) guidelines and REMARK criteria. Recruitment reached 105 patients. Median age was 67.1 years, with 57 ELN intermediate-risk patients. Median follow-up and OS are 1.54 and 0.95 years, respectively. NMT1 MFI was consistent through all samples. NMT2 MFI was higher in lymphocytes (mean MFI = 3.01 M-BM-1 0.08) vs. monocytes (mean MFI = 0.98 M-BM-1 0.03, p < 0.001) NMT2 MFI did not vary between AML bulk blast (mean MFI = 1.13 M-BM-1 0.03), CD34+ blast (mean MFI = 1.21 M-BM-1 0.03), and CD34+38- blast populations (mean MFI 1.22 M-BM-1 0.04) (p = 0.145). NMT2 MFI was significantly higher in control CD34+ cells (mean MFI = 1.65 M-BM-1 0.11, p < 0.001) and CD34+38- cells (mean MFI = 1.91 M-BM-1 0.17, p < 0.001) versus their AML counterparts. NMT2 MFI was significantly higher in AML with the cytogenetic abnormality inv(16) (mean MFI = 1.67 M-BM-1 0.05, p < 0.001), and slightly lower with mutated NPM1 (mean MFI = 1.09 M-BM-1 0.04, p = 0.004). NMT2 MFI was not associated with ELN risk groups or remission status. (p=0.166, 0.303). NMT2 MFI receiver operator curve analysis for OS in ELN intermediate-risk AML in CD34+38- cells generated a cut-off 1.28 (AUC=0.697, p=0.021) for sensitivity=50% and specificity=80%. Kaplan-Meier analysis was significant with respect to RFS in the CD34+38- population (p = 0.038) and OS in the bulk blast population (p = 0.005). Kaplan-Meier analysis was significant with respect to OS for bulk blast (p = 0.048) and CD34+38- population (p = 0.014) when analyzing the intermediate-risk, age < 65 years patient subgroup. NMT2 was not significant for RFS or OS versus the ELN scheme by univariate or multivariate Cox regression. NMT2 MFI for all intermediate-risk patients was not significant for RFS on univariate Cox regression, but was significant on multivariate regression (p = 0.019). NMT2 MFI for OS in all intermediate-risk patients was significant on univariate Cox regression (p = 0.007) but not significant on multivariate analysis. Age and WBC at diagnosis were used as covariates. We analyzed how NMT1 and NMT2 MFI relate to clinical factors, cytogenetics, molecular abnormalities, ELN risk group, and clinical outcomes in AML. NMT1 was not associated with any of these factors. NMT2 MFI was intermediate in normal hematopoietic stem cells, higher in lymphocytes, and lower in monocytes. This suggests that regulation of NMT2 protein levels may influence early lymphoid/myeloid lineage commitment, possibly by modulation of the T-cell receptor pathway. The cytogenetic abnormality inv(16) showed significantly higher NMT2 MFI, possibly secondary to control of NMT2 expression by the transcriptional regulators RUNX2 and RUNX3. NMT2 MFI was moderately lower in patients with NPM1. NMT2 MFI was not associated with ELN risk group, or achievement of CR with first induction chemotherapy. Higher NMT2 MFI generally predicted worsened outcomes in the ELN intermediate-risk population, with this effect being driven by the CD34+38- blast subsets. This may represent an indirect measure of the stemness of the blast population, and the LSC burden in patients with AML. NMT2 MFI may be a novel biomarker for prognosis in intermediate-risk AML, and further investigation is warranted." ;

    ns1:abstract "Transition metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions are widely used transformations to generate useful chemicals. The development of new variants for transition metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions provides more efficient methods for the construction of functionalized molecules. This thesis describes the study of two novel transition metal-catalyzed cross-coupling processes. Chapter 1 describes the decarboxylative cross-coupling of malonic acid derivatives and heteroarylboronic esters. The use of oxidative Cu catalysis enables the synthesis of monoheteroaryl acetate derivatives containing electrophilic functional groups under mild conditions. This heteroarylation transformation provides a new route for late-stage functionalization for the preparation of drugs. The reaction development and the scope of both malonic acid derivatives and heteroarylboronic esters are detailed. The discovery of a Z-favored Rh-catalyzed olefination between diazo esters and iodonium electrophiles is discussed in Chapter 2. This reaction exhibits complementary stereoselectivity to the established E-alkene synthesis via Pd-catalyzed carbene cross-coupling. The preliminary optimization results of the Rh-catalyzed olefination are summarized." ;

    ns5:abstract "The Dlx1/Dlx2 double knockout (DKO) mouse dies at P0 with a cleft palate and a distended abdomen. Within the intestinal crypts of Leiberkuhn a stable, non-dividing stem cell group is marked by the oncogene BMI1. Unpublished data from the Eisenstat laboratory demonstrates co-expression of BMI1 and the homeobox transcription factor DLX2 in the intestinal crypts and also suggests a role for DLX2 in the regulation of expression of the Ret proto-oncogene. Ret is responsible for enteric nervous system (ENS) development.  Over-expression of RET induces Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type cancers whereas RET loss-of-function is associated with HirschsprungM-bM-^@M-^Ys Disease (HD) with partial or complete loss of intestinal innervation. We investigated the potential regulatory effect of DLX2 on Bmi1 and Ret. Our hypothesis was that DLX2 suppresses Bmi1 while promoting Ret expression through direct binding of the gene targetsM-bM-^@M-^Y promoters during intestinal and ENS development.  Methods: Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays using a polyclonal DLX2 antibody and embryonic intestinal tissues studied candidate in vivo interactions between DLX2 and target promoter regions of genomic DNA. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) and site directed mutagenesis of DLX2 binding sites was used to determine if there was direct binding by DLX2 of the Bmi1/ Ret regulatory regions identified by ChIP in vitro. Reporter gene assays were applied to assess the effect of Dlx2 co-expression on Bmi1/ Ret expression in vitro. Quantitative PCR analysis of the embryonic gastrointestinal tract demonstrated the in vivo effect of loss of Dlx1/Dlx2 expression on Ret and Bmi1 expression when comparing wild-type to Dlx1/Dlx2 DKO mouse tissues.  Results: DLX2 interaction with specific regions of the Bmi1 and RetM-bM-^@M-^Ys promoters in vivo was demonstrated using ChIP. The potential for specific binding of DLX2 to only a subset of the promoters identified by ChIP assays in vitro was demonstrated by EMSA assay. The in vitro regulatory effects of DLX2 on the expression of these genes were revealed through luciferase gene reporter assays: Ret expression was repressed whereas Bmi1 expression was activated.  In vivo analysis shows a significant change in ret expression in the Dlx1/Dlx2 DKO when measured by qPCR. Ret expression was decreased in the small intestine and increased in the large intestine at E13 in the DKO. However, Bmi1 shows no change in intestinal expression at E18 with the loss of Dlx1/Dlx2 gene function.  Conclusion: Occupancy of the Bmi1 and Ret promoters by DLX2 in vivo occurs at specific time points, while EMSAs demonstrate direct binding of DLX2 to specific promoter regions in vitro. While reporter gene assays show the ability of DLX2 to repress ret expression in vitro, in vivo this regulation may be influenced by proximal/distal patterning which may also underlie the severity of the various phenotypes of HD. While DLX2 shows in vitro regulatory potential over Bmi1expression, in vivo assays did not support a regulatory interaction during embryonic development.  Ongoing expression studies of cell-type specific markers for epithelial and ganglion cell markers in the intestine and ENS in the Dlx1/Dlx2 DKO mouse as well as in human HD biopsies will further explore the biological significance of DLX2 on intestinal and ENS development." ;

        "Kainic acid",
        "M-NM-2-amyloid" ;
    ns2:abstract "Kainic acid is a non-degradable analogue of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate that, when injected systemically into adult rats, can trigger seizures and progressive neuronal loss in a manner that mirrors the neuropathology of human mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE), most prevalent form of partial epilepsy. However, the biomolecular mechanisms responsible for the neuronal loss that occurs as a consequence of this treatment remain elusive. Recent studies from our lab have shown that kainic acid administration can lead to increased levels/processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) in activated astrocytes leading to enhanced production of amyloid-M-NM-2 (AM-NM-2) peptides, which are known to play a critical role in the neurodegeneration observed in AlzheimerM-bM-^@M-^Ys disease. At present, however, the functional consequences of AM-NM-2 peptides on kainic acid-induced loss of neurons remain unclear. Thus, in this study, we seek to establish the potential role of kainic acid-induced astrocytic AM-NM-2 peptides on the degeneration of neurons. Our results show that kainic acid treatment of human U373 astrocytoma and rat primary astrocyte cells yields increased levels/processing of APP, resulting in enhanced AM-NM-2 production/secretion without compromising cell viability. Additionally, we reveal that kainic acid induces neuronal loss more in neuronal/astrocyte co-cultures than pure neuronal cultures, and this is attenuated by precluding AM-NM-2 production. Furthermore, using selective ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists, we show that the kainate receptor is specifically responsible for facilitating enhanced amyloidogenesis in astrocytes, thus implying an important role for this underexplored receptor in a disease context. These results suggest that AM-NM-2 peptides derived from astrocytes may have a role in kainic acid-induced neurodegeneration. Since administering kainic acid can recapitulate the main pathological features of MTLE, it is possible that the mechanisms similar to those observed in this study may also be responsible for the degeneration of neurons in this disease." ;

    ns3:abstract "The tumour suppressor protein p53 maintains genomic integrity by coordinating the DNA damage response, which includes growth arrest, DNA damage repair, and apoptotic cell death. p53 is mutated in more than 50% of human cancer, which reflects its importance. The complex mechanism that controls the regulation of p53 remains only partially understood. p53 is mainly regulated by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination. Following exposure to DNA-damaging agents, protein kinases such as ATM and ATR activate and stabilize p53 via phosphorylation. In unstressed cells, ubiquitin ligases bind and assist to degrade p53, keeping p53 at the basal level to enable the cellM-bM-^@M-^Ys normal function. The MDM2 ubiquitin ligase represents the most extensively studied negative regulator of p53. Previous studies with unstressed cells have shown that UBE4B, a p53 ubiqutin ligase, is essential for MDM2-mediated p53 polyubiquitination and degradation both in vitro and in vivo. However, the role of UBE4B in regulating p53 in response to DNA damage remains unknown.  This dissertation hypothesized that ATM or ATR phosphorylates p53, thus affecting its level and disrupting UBE4B-p53 interactions in response to DNA damage. Also, UBE4B constitutes a critical p53 negative regulator in the ATM- or ATR-dependent pathway. To test this hypotheses, the main objectives of this study aimed to (i) determine the levels of UBE4B, MDM2, and p53 following DNA damage; (ii) explore the phosphorylation status of p53 following DNA damage; (iii) examine the interactions of UBE4B and MDM2 with p53; (iv) determine the effects of UBE4B and MDM2 on p53 degradation and (v) analyze the cytoplasmic as well as nuclear localization of p53, UBE4B, and MDM2. Most experiments involved human cells that express wild-type p53, with a few experiments including p53-null cells.  Non-cancerous ATM-proficient and ATM-deficient EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines that grow in suspension were employed. In addition, some studies were performed with cancerous (MCF7 and H1299) and non-cancerous (MCF10) cell lines that grow as adherent cultures. Western blot analysis was performed to detect the protein levels and co-immunoprecipitation was utilized to explore the protein-protein interactions. Moreover, DNA extraction and transformation were used to prepare various constructs. Cellular fractionation analysis was utilized to investigate the subcellular localization of proteins and flow cytometric analysis was used to examine cell cycle distributions. The findings with lymphoblastoid cells suggested that induced UBE4B levels and interactions with p53 are ATM-independent. However, it is unknown whether ATR signalling or some other protein kinase p53 activator may constitute the predominant pathway operating in AT cells. Consistent with previous reports, the data in this study revealed that UBE4B binds to and promotes the degradation of phosphorylated forms of p53, such as Ser15 or Ser392, after exposure to ionizing radiation (IR); furthermore, this investigation found that this downregulation remains independent of MDM2.  In conclusion, these research findings provide new insights into the potential role of UBE4B in p53 regulation via the ATM or ATR pathway following response to DNA damage. Collectively, the data revealed that the pattern of UBE4B induction or its interactions with p53 in ATM positive wild-type cells differs from that in AT cells, supporting the previous studies which reported that UBE4B may negatively regulate phosphorylated p53 in response to ionizing radiation. Further investigations are needed to explore the role of UBE4B in p53 regulation, especially within various contexts of the DNA damage response. Such studies will assist to better understand the ever-expanding complexity of p53 regulation, which eventually may contribute towards developing novel p53-based therapeutic cancer approaches." ;

    ns1:subject "Atherosclerosis",
        "Choline",
        "PEMT" ;
    ns8:abstract "Phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT) is a hepatic enzyme that converts phosphatidylethanolamine to phosphatidylcholine. Pemt-/- mice are protected from obesity and insulin resistance, a phenotype that is reversed with dietary choline supplementation. Additionally, PEMT deficiency reduces plasma lipids and is protective against atherosclerosis when crossed with the low-density lipoprotein receptor (Ldlr-/-) mice. Recent studies have demonstrated that choline can be metabolized by the gut microbiota into trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), which is a novel risk factor for atherosclerosis. The effect of choline supplementation on the development of atherosclerosis in Pemt-/-/Ldlr-/- mice is not known. Therefore, the objective of this thesis was to determine whether reintroducing hepatic PEMT expression or dietary choline supplementation promotes atherosclerosis in Pemt-/-/Ldlr-/- mice. Pemt+/+/Ldlr-/- (SKO) and Pemt-/-/Ldlr-/-  (DKO) mice were injected with an adeno-associated virus (AAV) expressing green florescent protein (GFP) or human PEMT, and fed a western diet (40% calories from fat, 0.5% cholesterol, 3g/kg choline) for 8 weeks.  In a separate experiment, SKO and DKO mice were fed the western diet containing 3 or 10g/kg choline for 12 weeks. The results demonstrated that DKO mice have low plasma lipids and were protected against atherosclerosis compared to SKO mice. AAV-PEMT administration increased plasma lipids and TMAO in DKO mice. Furthermore, AAV-PEMT injected DKO mice developed atherosclerotic lesions similar to SKO mice. In the second study, choline supplementation in DKO mice did not increase atherosclerosis or plasma lipids, but did increase plasma TMAO levels.  Next, we sought to investigate whether reducing dietary choline influences TMAO production and development of atherosclerosis in SKO mice. We found that reducing dietary choline attenuated atherosclerosis in SKO mice compared to mice fed a high choline diet. However, decreasing choline did not alter plasma lipids or TMAO production.  In summary, this thesis focused on the role of dietary choline and PEMT enzyme in the development of atherosclerosis. We found reintroducing hepatic PEMT expression reversed the atheroprotective phenotype of DKO mice while choline supplementation did not increase atherosclerosis or plasma lipids. Our data suggests that plasma TMAO levels do not always correlate with atherosclerosis and plasma lipids. Furthermore, this is the first report suggesting that de novo choline synthesis alters TMAO metabolism.   Overall this research work contributes significantly towards our understanding of the complex relationship of dietary choline, de novo choline and TMAO production and how these factors influence the development of atherosclerosis and lipid metabolism." ;

I started from the chiral pool using L-proline and obtained ipalbidine with an ee of >99.6%. Chapter 2 describes synthetic studies towards the total synthesis of sorbicillactone A. Most of the carbon skeleton of sorbicillactone A was assembled. However, the amination and methylation steps at C-3 remain to be accomplished. Several different approaches were explored to add stereoselectively the amino and methyl group at C-3. The most promising approach appears to be an unusual Claisen rearrangement that introduces two carbons at C-3 so constituted that they can be manipulated individually with one of them eventually being replaced by nitrogen." ;

    ns2:subject "Fluorescence",

        "TD-DFT",
        "Two-photon absorption" ;
    ns1:abstract "The photostability of nucleic acid constituents is crucial in maintaining the integrity of our genetic code. This is achieved by the essential mechanism of ultrafast radiationless decay of the singlet excited state to the electronic ground state of nucleobases. While this mechanism provides resilience against mutations to the genetic code, it results in the non-emissive nature of the canonical building blocks of nucleic acids. Consequently, the conformational dynamics of DNA and RNA are difficult to study by fluorescence spectroscopy and imaging. Investigations on the structure and function of these biomolecules can be achieved with fluorescent probes that mimic the natural components of nucleic acids without perturbing the overall structure. Hence, the design of such \"isomorphic\" nucleoside analogues is highly desired in the field of bioimaging.   The photophysical properties of nucleoside analogues are very sensitive to structural modifications. In particular, the nature of the low-lying excited electronic states, presence of long range excitations, conformational flexibility, tautomerization, and access to non-radiative deactivation pathways such as conical intersections (CIs), have significant impact on fluorescence. The vast majority of fluorescent analogues are also sensitive to their local environment. Base stacking, base sequence dependence and base pairing, i.e., hydrogen bonding interactions, all play pivotal roles in the incorporation of analogues into oligomers and helical structures. This thesis outlines computational investigations of these properties for a variety of isomorphic nucleoside analogues.   Initial work in this thesis (Chapter 2) involves the evaluation of the photophysical properties of thieno-modified analogues with time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT). These preliminary investigations shed light on the energetics of CI pathways. Meanwhile, the presence of stable tautomers confirmed with computational studies  (Chapter 3) helps explain the unique spectral features observed in experimental results. Further investigations on base pairing interactions (Chapter 5) of these analogues illustrate the structural similarities to their natural counterparts.    As the analogues studied in this work have potential utility in bioimaging, it is important that they be biocompatible for in vivo applications. Light penetration into biological media is very poor at short wavelengths due to increased absorption and scattering. As a result, multi-photon absorption techniques can be utilized to overcome the disadvantages of one-photon absorption. Multi-photon excitation reduces out-of-focus photobleaching, ensures localization of the incident light, and absorption occurs at higher wavelengths which allows for deeper penetration into biological tissue. The utility of analogues for two-photon fluorescence spectroscopy is analyzed by computation of the two-photon absorption (TPA) cross sections in Chapter 4.  Studies on the conformational flexibility of select analogues uncover differences in TPA properties that could account for experimental discrepancies.  The ultimate goal of the work done in this thesis is the utilization of the knowledge obtained from computational studies in the design of new analogues with the desired physical and spectral properties. While the aim is to provide computational insight for advances in the development of tuneable isomorphic nucleoside analogues, it is equally important to elucidate the reasons behind undesired properties of analogues. This is a vibrant field of research which requires collaboration between synthetic chemists, spectroscopists, biologists, as well as theoretical chemists." ;

    ns2:abstract "Network connectivity is an indispensable component of any computer related activities. Any computer-like machine is connected to some kind of a network, which is further connected to another computer network. Technological advances allow users to connect any devices and use multiple applications. As the result, the complexity of network systems is constantly growing. The fact that almost all devices are connected means that any attempt to break into a device or a system is occurring via a computer network. In other words, networks and their connected devices are targets of intrusions. The increased dependency on computer systems and the growing number of malicious activities increase a pressure on governmental, industrial and private institutions to utilize security systems capable of monitoring and analyzing network traffic, and detecting malicious or suspicious activities. The research topic of Intrusion Detection becomes of special importance. Intrusion Detection involves two processes: detecting cyber attacks using well-know attack patterns M-bM-^@M-^S Signature Detection (Signature ID), or identifying anomalous behaviour of network traffic M-bM-^@M-^S Anomaly Detection (Anomaly ID). Recently, a hybrid approach has emerged that tries to harvest advantages of both signature and anomaly detection methods. Despite the promising prospects, hybrid Intrusion Detection System (IDS)s still need to demonstrate their usefulness and good performance. Some ii of problems and unsolved issues are related to the lack of: 1) a detailed representation of network traffic that allows to recognize small differences in a traffic or detect non-standard cyber attacks; and 2) an accurately labeled data that contain different cases of anomalies and attacks. In this thesis, we propose a Two-stage Hybrid Intrusion Detection System able to detect anomalies and attacks, and reporting its findings to a security administrator. The system includes three sub-systems: 1) Network Data Collecting and Processing (NetDataCoP) Module; 2) Anomaly Detection Module; and 3) Signature DetectionModule. In order to design this system, a novel, comprehensive and multi-perspective description of network traffic has been proposed. It includes more than hundred features representing a traffic at different levels of granularity, at different layers, involving different protocols, all determined over different temporal intervals. One of essential aspects of the system is its ability to identify and categorize application connections that utilize UDP M-bM-^@M-^S a connection-less protocol. The processes of detecting anomalies and attacks are built using algorithms of Machine Learning. The system utilize elements of Evidence Theory not only to detect anomaly/attack but also to identify a degree of confidence in its detection outcomes. The results are highly promising. The implemented and tested system provides a very good performance, i.e., a number of false negatives (assuming anomaly/attack as a positive event) is zero, with a minimal number of false positives at the same time." ;

    ns2:abstract "Hsp90 is an essential eukaryotic molecular chaperone that plays a critical role in protein folding. It regulates the stability, maturation, and activation of numerous client proteins, many of which are involved in oncogenesis. It has been well established that Hsp90 is tightly regulated by co-chaperone proteins and post-translational modifications (PTMs) in the context of an ATP-driven, functional cycle. Although Hsp90 is a homodimeric ATPase, growing evidence suggest that it functions as an asymmetric machine, where each subunit becomes individually functionalized when co-chaperones and clients bind, or when PTMs occur. Much remains to be elucidated about how these asymmetric interactions and modifications influence Hsp90 function. The goal of my thesis was to define a biochemical and mechanical model  for the asymmetric interactions of co-chaperones with Hsp90 and how they regulate the ATPase activity of Hsp90. Various Hsp90 mutants were used in the context of homodimers and heterodimers in ATPase assay to conduct in-depth analyses on how co-chaperones regulate Hsp90 activity. Specifically, I demonstrated that co-chaperones exert different effects on Hsp90 depending on which subunit they bind and proposed a model outlining the mechanism of Aha1p-mediated stimulation of Hsp90 ATPase activity. How asymmetric SUMOylation of Hsp90 influence co-chaperone regulation of the ATPase activity of Hsp90 was also addressed. This was achieved by developing a novel strategy to chemically couple SUMO to Hsp90 in vitro. My analysis revealed that chemically SUMOylated Hsp90 recapitulates the selectivity of co-chaperone binding that is observed in vivo, mainly Aha1p-recruitment, but also demonstrated that SUMOylation impairs Sba1p regulation. Lastly, I investigated the conformational dynamics of Hsp90 by restricting interdomain rearrangements of Hsp90 using linker truncation mutants. These analyses brought novel insight into which Hsp90 conformations favor Aha1p and/or Sba1p binding.  My work provides a framework to integrate subunit-specific interactions of co-chaperones and PTMs to further elucidate how the functional cycle of Hsp90 is regulated. It is crucial to understand how Hsp90 functions at a molecular level to advance the development of therapeutics that target the Hsp90 system." ;

    ns5:abstract "Background: Cancer cachexia is referred to as a wasting condition, with skeletal muscle and fat loss. Although heart atrophy is recognized as a notable component of experimental cancer cachexia models, it has not been characterized in human studies. The contribution of cardiac structural and functional impairment to worsening performance status, fatigue progression and dyspnea, is known in the context of heart failure; however, the pertinent clinical information in cancer cachexia has never been examined. Cancer cachexia still does not have an approved therapy; regulatory agencies claim functional measures such as stair climbing test improvement as a clinical benefit of experimental agents, however, the matter of heart function and structure at baseline and its alteration over time (as a potential source of functional variation) is ignored. In the absence of any clinical evidence for cardiac structure or function changes in cachexia context, two retrospective evaluations of cardiac function were conducted in pursuit of preliminary evidence of either: a) altered cardiac function over time in renal cell carcinoma patients or, b) evidence of concurrent cachexia and abnormally low cardiac mass in cirrhosis patients with or without hepatocellular carcinoma.  My major hypothesis through a longitudinal work was that heart is being atrophied and is dysfunctional in parallel to cancer cachexia progression.        Methods: Three different clinical projects were considered for my PhD research (two retrospective/chart reviews and one longitudinal cohort study). In all these studies, standard of care computed tomography cross-sectional images were utilized to quantify skeletal muscle and fat. In the longitudinal study, we measured heart systolic [left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and global longitudinal strain] and diastolic function in addition to left ventricular mass at baseline (before start of carboplatin-based therapy) and over time (4 months later) in patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (n=72). Standard questionnaires for assessment of performance status, fatigue and dyspnea also were applied.      For the first retrospective study, cirrhotic patients (n=100) with or without hepatocellular carcinoma were studied; values for left ventricular mass were abstracted from available echocardiography reports before liver transplant. For the second retrospective study in renal cell carcinoma patients (n=47), several multigated acquisition scans were gathered over one year of assessment to detect changes in LVEF.        Results: For the first time we demonstrated the occurrence of left ventricular mass atrophy in a group of patients with progressive cachexia and non-small cell lung cancer. Atrophy of left ventricular mass (median overall -8.9%, p<0.001) occurred during 112M-BM-16 days; this loss was equal or greater than the loss of skeletal muscle (overall -6.2%, p<0.001).  Atrophy >8.9% of left ventricular mass associated with loss of skeletal muscle (OR, 95% CI) [4.5 (1.4-14.8) p<0.01] and total adipose tissue [10.0 (2.7-36.7) (p<0.01)]. While LVEF and diastolic function changes over time were not associated with left ventricular mass atrophy, left ventricular mass loss was associated with decreased global longitudinal strain [6.6 (1.9-22.7); p<0.01], worsening of fatigue [6.6 (1.9-22.7) (p<0.01)], aggravated performance status [4.8 (1.3-18.3); p<0.05] and deteriorated dyspnea [9.3 (2.4-35.8); p<0.01]. In non-small cell lung cancer patients, while their performance status at baseline was sufficient to receive chemotherapy, and these patients were potentially eligible for clinical trials, we found different types of cardiac disorders that may lead to confounded functional measures in clinical trials. For instance we found 9 patients (12.8%) to have clinically-relevant cardiac disorders [7 patients with (LVEF <50%)]. Ten (14.3%) other patients showed to have diastolic dysfunction with preserved LVEF.        In cirrhotic patients with most depleted left ventricular mass index (>1 SD below sex-specific mean value of left ventricular mass indexed by height2) compared to the patients with average left ventricular mass index, sarcopenia was more prevalent (70.6% vs. 27.3%; 6.4 (1.9M-bM-^@M-^S20.7); pM-bM-^@M-^I=M-bM-^@M-^I0.002). Fat loss also showed a trend to be more prevalent in group of patients with low left ventricular mass index.        In renal cell carcinoma patients multigated acquisition scan-defined cardio-toxicity appeared in 8/47 (17%) patients. This targeted therapy-induced cardio-toxicity was related to high fat mass at baseline [9.5 (1.1-86.0), p=0.04]; also the percentage of skeletal muscle loss over 1 year in patients with cardio-toxicity was greater than patients without cardiotoxicity [median loss -7.0% versus 0%, respectively; p=0.04].        Conclusion: Dynamic cardiac atrophy is reported for the first time in human patients with progressive cancer cachexia. Cardiac status in terms of structure and function should be recognized in further clinical trials." ;

    ns2:abstract "Anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions are driving climate change. The largest sources of emitted carbon dioxide are coal and fossil fuel power plants. One proposed solution to mitigate emissions is to capture carbon dioxide from fossil fuel power plants and store it underground. This is the basis of carbon capture and storage (CCS). There are two main carbon capture processes that are utilized in industry: pre- and post-combustion capture. In post-combustion capture, the fuel is combusted to generate power and then carbon dioxide is separated afterwards. In pre-combustion capture, a fuel is gasified and catalytically converted to mostly carbon dioxide and hydrogen; the hydrogen is then combusted to generate power. Adsorption has been suggested as a possible mechanism to capture carbon dioxide. In early design stages it is practical to simulate an adsorbent using a process model. This cuts costs and time associated with physical experiments. This thesis characterized and built models for adsorptive pre- and post-combustion processes. TDA Research Inc. (Wheat Ridge, CO, USA) has developed an activated carbon adsorbent called TDA 2015 (a pseudonym for patent protections) for pre-combustion carbon capture. A series of dynamic column breakthrough experiments were performed to determine equilibrium loadings and to build a model in our in-house adsorption simulator. These experiments were performed at approximately 160, 200 and 240 degrees Celsius and approximately 2.5, 4.5, 6.5, 8.5 and 10.5 bar of carbon dioxide. Additional equilibrium loadings were measured using volumetry at 30, 60, 120 and 160 degrees Celsius from vacuum to 1.2 bar. At this time hydrogen was not characterized, but it known to be very weakly adsorbing on TDA 2015. A LRC isotherm was fit to the equilibrium data and utilized in the adsorption simulator. At approximately 2.5, 4.5 and 6.5 bar of carbon dioxide the experimental and simulated results were in good agreement. However, at 8.5 and 10.5 bar of carbon dioxide, the LRC isotherm could quantitatively predict the loading, but not qualitatively predict the concentration or thermal breakthrough shape. A case study was performed to determine possible explanations to this behavior. For post-combustion capture, a premium (Z10-02ND) and standard (Z10-02) zeolite 13X were obtained from Zeochem (Uetikon am See, Switzerland) and studied. Water adsorbs very strongly on zeolite 13X. Due to this fact it usually neglected in adsorptive post-combustion capture studies. For this study, post-combustion flue gas is considered as a mixture of carbon dioxide, water and nitrogen. Carbon dioxide and nitrogen equilibrium loadings were measured from 0 to 150 degrees Celsius and 0 to 5 bar using volumetry and gravimetry. Equilibrium data was fit to a dual-site Langmuir isotherm for all components. A series of single component carbon dioxide and water breakthrough experiments were measured on both zeolite 13X samples at 22 degrees Celsius and 1.02 bar. These were modeled and simulated with the in-house adsorption simulator. The simulator predicted breakthrough behavior well for all materials and components. Competitive carbon dioxide and water breakthrough experiments were then performed at 22 degrees Celsius and 1.02 bar. The competitive breakthrough experiments were also simulated with the breakthrough simulator. However, the dual-site Langmuir isotherm was not able to capture the nonideality of the carbon dioxide and water mixture well." ;

    ns6:abstract "Cellular stresses and signaling that lead to the initiation of apoptotic pathways often result in the activation of proteases such as caspases which in turn culminate in the generation of proteolytically activated protein fragments with new or altered roles. Recent work has revealed that the activity of some of the caspase-generated activated pro-apoptotic protein fragments can be mitigated via their selective degradation by the N-end rule pathway. In this work, I report the investigations that examined the role of the N-end rule pathway in regulating apoptotic cell death via selective protein degradation of specific crucial cleaved pro- and anti-apoptotic fragments in mammalian cell lines. My investigation has focused on three cleaved protein fragments (cleaved fragments of Lyn kinase, BMX kinase and PKC-theta). Selective degradation of the C-terminal fragments of these three diverse protein kinases implicates an expansive role for the N-end rule pathway in the complex network of apoptotic pathways. The degradation of the anti-apoptotic cleaved Lyn kinase by the N-end rule pathway in K562 cell line revealed that N-end rule pathway may target anti-apoptotic protein fragments and thus regulates the apoptotic threshold in certain cells. Tellingly, the N-end-rule-mediated degradation of the pro-apoptotic cleaved BMX kinase in cancer-derived cell lines provides an example for an N-end rule-mediated anti-apoptotic response for cancer cell survival via destroying an endogenous caspase-generated pro-apoptotic protein fragment. Lastly, I have determined that the pro-apoptotic cleaved fragment of PKC-theta is unstable in mammalian cells as its N-terminal lysine targets it for proteasomal degradation via the N-end rule pathway and this degradation dampens the potent pro-apoptotic function of the cleaved fragment of PKC-theta. Collectively, this work delineates some of the functional scope of N-end rule pathway with respect to apoptotic cell death and supports the notion that targeting N-end rule machinery may have therapeutic implications." ;

    ns4:abstract "High pressure carbon dioxide adsorption processes are employed in applications such as carbon dioxide capture and supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC). Carbon dioxide capture using adsorption has gained wide attention because of the promising materials that are developed for this application. On the other hand, supercritical fluid chromatography is one of the most prominent techniques for chiral separations in the pharmaceutical and food industry. Supercritical fluids (such as carbon dioxide), when compared to liquid solvents, have low viscosities and high solute diffusion coefficients. This allows for operations at high flow rates with low pressure drops (hence high productivities). The thesis addresses the design and evaluation of adsorption processes for carbon dioxide capture and development of modeling tools to understand the SFC processes.  The first part of the thesis deals with pre-combustion carbon dioxide capture using pressure swing adsorption (PSA) process in an integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) power plant. IGCC power plants provide favorable conditions for carbon dioxide capture (high operating pressures around 35 bar and high carbon dioxide compositions of 30-40 %). A variety of PSA cycle configurations that were earlier designed based on a modified activated carbon, are subjected to a process optimization so as to maximize the performance of the PSA process. A multi-objective optimization framework is developed using an evolutionary algorithm with objective functions as carbon dioxide purity-recovery, parasitic energy and productivity of the PSA process. The study presents the formulation of an extensive model for the parasitic energy and a systematic analysis to understand the effect of low pressure and carbon dioxide purity. The Pareto curves obtained at the end of optimizations are examined for the process feasibility.   The second part of the thesis focuses on developing a comprehensive axi-symmetric computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model in order to understand the dynamics of a plug introduced through a mixed-stream injection in supercritical fluid chromatographic columns. Two main phenomena contribute to chromatographic band distortions: the different retention behaviors of solute in the plug and in the mobile phases; and viscous fingering, a phenomenon where less viscous mobile phase penetrates into more viscous plug. The aim of this study is to confirm the existence of viscous fingering and explain the peak distortions arising due to large-volume injections in SFC columns. The model takes into account of key phenomena that influence peak shapes in SFC, namely, the injection of fluids with different viscosities, variation of solute retention with local mobile phase composition and pressure. Finally, the simulated elution peaks of solute are compared against the experiments." ;

    ns2:abstract "In order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, realizing an energy efficient carbon dioxide capture process is important. Adsorption based carbon capture is a potential low energy separation technology. Although there have been considerable advances in this field, a full technological maturity of adsorption for carbon capture is yet to be achieved. The main aim of this thesis is to gain a better understanding of Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) design for both pre and post-combustion based carbon dioxide capture. The first part of this thesis will investigate post-combustion carbon dioxide capture. Specifically, the recently published of diamine appended metal organic frameworks (MOFs) that show an unusual S-Shape isotherm for carbon dioxide. The characteristic carbon dioxide uptake of these materials shows a possibility to obtain larger theoretical working capacities when compared to typical classical materials such as Zeolite 13X which are Langmuirian-type isotherms. The performance of five different materials with S-Shape isotherms in a four step Vacuum Swing Adsorption(VSA) cycle was assessed using comprehensive simulation models. The optimization of VSA processes was achieved using a genetic algorithm. The optimization results establish the key link between feed temperature and the material. The materials showed a 20% improvement in energy reduction to the benchmark adsorbent Zeolite 13X. The diamine appended MOF-Mn showed a parasitic energy of 140 kW hr/ tonne carbon dioxide captured compared to Zeolite 13X, which is 170 kW hr/ tonne carbon dioxide captured. The purity and recovery of carbon dioxide were maintained at >95% and >90%, respectively for the energy and productivity related studies. The second part of this study deals with the design of pressure swing adsorption (PSA) cycles for implementation in a pre-combustion based carbon dioxide capture. Working with TDA Research Inc. Colorado, we have developed novel pressure swing adsorption cycles for their patented TDA AMS-19 material. The adsorbent is an advanced physical adsorbent that is selective to carbon dioxide and is used for coal-derived synthesis gas separation for temperatures as high as 300M-bM-^WM-&C. The overall objective of this project was to show that this new material can achieve the targets for carbon dioxide purity and recovery set at 95% and 90%, respectively by the US Dept. of Energy (DOE). Six novel cycles were configured and studied in this work. The cycle configurations that achieved the DOE targets were also scheduled using a graphic scheduling approach to use in an 8 bed PSA unit, for field testing." ;

    ns5:abstract "Among the characteristic hallmarks of cancer cells is their high replicative potential, which in turn leads to the overexpression of the facilitative hexose transporters (GLUTs) to provide the energy required for cell growth and proliferation. Interestingly, in 1996 the major D-fructose transporter (GLUT5) was identified to be overexpressed in breast cancer cells compared to their healthy counterparts. The first part of this thesis describes the synthesis and biological evaluation of four C-2 fluorescently labeled D-fructose derivatives that were developed to target GLUT5. Based on the findings with the fluorescently labeled compounds, an optimized synthetic pathway was developed for the synthesis of the corresponding C-2 modified D-fructose derivatives bearing a fluorinated side chain. This pathway can be applied for the synthesis of [18F] PET imaging agents. The second part of this thesis describes the design and synthesis of novel noscapine analogues as cytotoxic agents targeting microtubules. Nine new compounds have been successfully synthesized and biologically evaluated as potential antiproliferative agents. Interestingly, one of the developed analogues showed superior cytotoxic activity over the parent noscapine molecule. Computational data suggest binding of these compounds to both colchicine and noscapine binding sites; however, a higher affinity to the colchicine site." ;

    ns6:abstract "Objective: We sought to determine if azithromycin, a macrolide antibiotic with anti-inflammatory(1,2), antibacterial(3) and potential antiviral(4) properties, added to routine therapy of wheezy pre-school children would resolve respiratory symptoms more rapidly, and protect against symptom reoccurrence longer than the addition of placebo. Study design: We completed a double blind, randomized, placebo-control trial in which pre-school children were randomized to receive five days of azithromycin or placebo in addition to their regular treatment in the emergency department. The primary outcome was time to resolution of symptoms during the following 21 days after enrolment. Secondary outcomes included the number of days children used a short-acting beta-agonist during the 21 days following randomization and the time to reoccurrence during the following six months of follow-up. Result: A total of the 300 wheezing children were randomized, 222 had sufficient data to be included in primary outcome analysis and 169 were analyzed for secondary outcomes. The treatment groups had similar demographics and clinical parameters at baseline. Median time to resolution of respiratory symptoms was four days for both treatment arms (interquartile range (IQR) 3,6; p=0.28). Median number of days of Short-Acting Beta-Agonist use among those who received azithromycin was four and a half days (IQR 2, 7) and five days (IQR 2, 9; p=0.22) among those who received placebo. Participants who received azithromycin had a 0.91 hazard ratio for time to six-month exacerbation compared to placebo (95% CI 0.61, 1.36, p=0.65). A pre-determined subgroup analysis showed no differences in outcomes for children with their first or repeat episode of wheezing. There was no significant difference in the proportion of participants experiencing an adverse event.  Conclusion: Azithromycin did not reduce the duration of respiratory symptoms nor the time to a respiratory exacerbation in the following six months after treatment among wheezing preschool children presenting to an emergency department. There was no significant effect among either first-time or prior wheezing children." ;

    ns2:abstract "Percutaneous needle insertion is a common type of minimally invasive surgery used for diagnostic and therapeutic applications such as biopsy, drug delivery, and cancer treatment. Prostate brachytherapy is a needle-based intervention, which is used for cancer treatment. In brachytherapy the surgeon inserts a needle into a patient's body such that radioactive seeds pre-loaded in the needles can be placed in or near the tumor, where radiation released from the seeds kills the cancer cells. Efficiency of needle-based interventions highly depends on accurate control of the needle tip trajectory. For instance, mean targeting accuracy of current techniques used in brachytherapy is 5 mm, which is a relatively large inaccuracy as the average prostate is about 50 mm in diameter. Autonomous or semi-autonomous needle adjustment systems can be used to control the needle tip trajectory and enhance needle insertion accuracy.   This dissertation explores the modeling and control of robotics-assisted needle steering with the aim of enhancing the performance of needle-based interventions. This dissertation's main theme is to deploy a medical robot system with minimal modification to clinical settings. Prostate brachytherapy is studied as an example of needle-based interventions. Robotics-assisted needle steering strategies are proposed that can reduce needle targeting error in various clinical scenarios in prostate brachytherapy, which will benefit the individual patient, the surgeon, and the health-care system in the long run.   Modeling the needle deflection and its interaction with soft tissue is the first requirement for robotic needle steering. A needle steering model can be used for designing the needle steering controller or estimating the needle/tissue system states that are not observable using 2D imaging modalities. In this research, several needle steering models are proposed that can predict needle deflection in soft tissue as a function of needle steering control inputs such as insertion velocity and needle axial rotation. The models are also capable of estimating needle steering states such as needle shape or needle tip orientation in soft tissue, thus enabling applications in motion planning and real-time control of needle steering.  The models are implemented for 2D and 3D needle steering, as well as fully automatic and semi-automated needle steering. In the fully automated needle steering the robot controls all the steering actions. In the semi-automated needle steering the robotic device shares the needle steering control inputs with the surgeon in the interest of ensuring the safety of the operation. Experimental results on synthetic and ex-vivo tissue samples demonstrate that the proposed strategies can significantly reduce needle targeting error in various scenarios in prostate brachytherapy. We also demonstrate that combining the proposed needle steering strategies with a novel flexible needle proposed in this research, provides new methods of reaching challenging targets to reduce number of conditions that are currently considered untreatable or inoperable." ;

Drawing on FoucaultM-bM-^@M-^Ys theories of governmentality and pastoral power, as well as on press scholarship, it argues that print media (the Vegetarian Advocate [1848-1851] and Vegetarian Messenger [1849-]) served as the pastor of the nineteenth-century vegetarian movement, shaping the conduct of its readers and eaters, and guiding them to their supposed moral and physical salvation. More specifically, I argue that the form of the periodical (its seriality and participatory framework) helped to create the new patterns of consumption and mechanisms of identification that became the basis of the movement. The monthly periodicity of vegetarian journals gave structure to the movement, while open forums such as correspondence invited readers into the construction of vegetarianismM-bM-^@M-^Ys meaning, identity, and practice. By returning to the archival matter of the Vegetarian Society, I recuperate an important debate on EnglandM-bM-^@M-^Ys consumer habits at a time of changing material and cultural conditions." ;

    ns5:abstract "Abstract This thesis investigates the reception of the forty full-text English medieval manuscripts of Walter Hilton's Scala perfectionis in order better to understand their cultural influence in late medieval England.  It presents evidence for and assesses the reception of the manuscripts individually in the first instance, and then bases the main argument on the results arising from this individual assessment.  The overall argument is presented first followed by the individual assessments of manuscripts in the form of a catalogue. This study argues that a thorough assessment of the evidence will not sustain the narrative which has gained a general scholarly consensus that the Carthusians are primarily responsible for the dissemination of full-text English Scala manuscripts.  The main discussion first presents the evidence for the production and distribution of these manuscripts.  Secondly, it evaluates the arguments put forward hitherto for Carthusian involvement in this distribution.  And, finally, it proposes that the evidence indicates the involvement of the Austin canons to some degree and weighs the current state of that evidence in a consideration of the possible extent of their engagement in this effort. The primary conclusions reached are, first, that the Cambridgeshire region is the main centre for the early production and distribution of Scala perfectionis manuscripts.  Secondly, the Carthusians came late to the work of making and disseminating Scala and, partly for this reason and partly because they had no houses in Cambridgeshire, cannot have played the dominant role.  Thirdly, despite the earlier scholarly dismissal of the role of Walter Hilton's order, that of the Austin canons, in circulating Scala, at least as much evidence exists for their earlier involvement as exists for the later involvement of the Carthusians, and, moreover, there are significant indicators that their efforts may have been dominant.  The evidence for the role of the Austin canons is more difficult to excavate because its medieval traces appear to have been more thoroughly decimated at the dissolution of the monasteries; consequently, the evidence that does exist must be weighed accordingly." ;

    ns3:abstract "Background: Current therapy for relapsed lymphoma includes high-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) as part of autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). This life saving treatment has a 50%-70% cure rate at 10 years; however, patients who undergo HSCT are at an increased risk for both direct (i.e. cardio-toxicity) and indirect (i.e. decreased functional status) negative effects. Due to the known detrimental cardiovascular (CV) effects of treatment, lymphoma patients from a tertiary cancer centre are referred to an eight-week multidisciplinary cardiac rehabilitation (CR) program following HSCT. This innovative approach to HSCT patients has not been documented in the literature. Aim: The aim of this qualitative study is to gain understanding of lymphoma patientsM-bM-^@M-^Y experiences of being referred to a multidisciplinary CR program following HSCT. Research Question: What is the experience of adult lymphoma patients who are referred to a cardiac rehabilitation program after treatment with HDCT and HSCT? Methods: A qualitative research approach (interpretive description) was used to guide data collection and analysis. A total of 10 semi-structured interviews were collected. Findings: Four major themes highlighting HSCT recipientsM-bM-^@M-^Y prioritization of CR in recovery; impact of HSCT on the CR experience; coping and resiliency during recovery; and information uptake were found. The experiences of HSCT patients in CR shares similarities to other CR literature, however the added burden of HSCT presents unique experiences that influence patient perceptions regarding CV health and risks. Outcomes: The results of this research will inform and improve the delivery of CR, a necessary and urgent need in this complex patient population. This study allows researchers, program developers, and multidisciplinary care teams to better understand the experiences of lymphoma patients referred to a CR program and adjust program delivery." ;

    ns3:abstract "Oral administration of drugs is considered advantageous over all other routes of drug delivery due to several benefits, including painless self-administration, lack of biohazardous waste, and easier and cold-chain free transportation. However, numerous environment sensitive drugs such as vaccines lose their therapeutic efficacy due to the extreme pH environment in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Till now, several methods have been proposed to produce microencapsulation systems for oral drug delivery, such as emulsion polymerization and spray drying. However, a universal, efficient, and effective drug delivery system for environment-sensitive biopharmaceuticals is still unavailable. The main drawback of emulsion polymerization method is the exposure of the drug to the organic solvent suspension during the microparticle synthesis process, which commonly causes loss of bioactivity of pharmaceuticals. Similarly, spray drying involves complicated optimization of the fabrication parameters such as temperature, concentrations, and feed rate for different types of drugs. To overcome these technical challenges, we have developed a novel and facile method of producing microparticles with pH-responsive macropores. And since the microparticle fabrication and drug encapsulation steps are independent, the problem of loss of bioactivity of drugs has been addressed. Microparticles were prepared using a FDA approved pH-responsive copolymer poly-(methacrylic acid-co-ethyl acrylate) with a monomer ratio of 1:1. Scanning electron microscopy analysis was used to study morphology and confirm the pore formation. The microparticles were sized ~35 M-NM-<m in diameter with pores' diameter ranging from 1-10 M-NM-<m. In a systematic approach, the effects of stirring, temperature, and evaporation time on pore formation were investigated. Following successful encapsulation of model drug (100 nm fluorescent nanoparticles, abbreviated as FNPs) and pH-sensitive drug (pravastatin sodium), the release profiles of ingredients were studied by employing UV-Vis, UV-MS, and fluorescence microscopy to demonstrate our proof-of-concept intestine-targeted drug delivery system. In this work, we found that the encapsulated pravastatin maintained > 60% of its original activity and was released after 6 hours of incubation in simulated GI tract environment which proved that the high effectiveness of our proof-of-concept microparticles drug delivery system." ;

    ns4:abstract "The most often used biofluids in metabolomics and disease biomarker discovery studies in the literature include urine, processed blood (serum or plasma), and cerebral spinal fluid. While investigations using these biofluids have led to numerous innovations in the field of metabolomics, little attention has been given to the possible clinical relevance of sweat. Very few studies have attempted to perform global sweat metabolomics with high sensitivity, coverage, and accurate quantification. The goal of this thesis work was to develop robust, sensitive, and accurate analytical workflows to use sweat in CIL LC-MS global metabolomics.  In Chapter 2, we profiled the metabolome of pure liquid sweat collected using an occlusive style sweat patch during 3 time points of moderate to intense exercise. Over 2707 unique metabolites were detected across 54 sweat samples collected from six individuals. We were able to positively identify 83 metabolites using a dansyl standard library, many of them never being reported as a part of the sweat metabolome. We observed significant metabolome differences in early vs. late exercise sweat samples, as well as between genders. This study demonstrated that CIL LC-MS can be used to detect metabolic changes in the sweat metabolome between comparative samples, justifying the use of sweat for future quantitative metabolomics research.  Chapter 3 describes an improved sweat metabolomics workflow that uses sweat collected using a non-occlusive patch. After analyzing sweat samples collected from forearm, neck, and lower back areas, a total of 3140 sweat metabolites were detected across 342 LC-MS runs with 84 metabolites positively identified using a dansyl standard library. We see a location dependence characteristic of sweat composition, as well as significant metabolome differences between male and female sweat. This work showed the applicability of non-occlusive sample collection and CIL-LC-MS to study phenotypic differences as well as mapping locations on the skin. Chapter 4 demonstrates the use of non-occlusive sweat collection combined with CIL LC-MS to study lymphedema in a real world clinical application. Sweat was collected from diseased and healthy areas of lymphedema patients, and preliminary data revealed metabolome differences between these collection areas which were not present in the same areas of healthy individuals. This project is currently being expanded to include more lymphedema patients in order to confirm the sweat metabolome trends observed." ;

    ns7:abstract "Since antiquity, fever has been documented as a physiological response to infection characterized by an increase in body temperature. Though fever is commonly regarded as a deleterious symptom of inflammation and is often suppressed using NSAID drugs, little is known about the effects that fever has on immunity due to the difficulty of experimentally blocking fever in traditional endothermic models. Interestingly, ectothermic animals have been seen to undergo a homologous behavioural fever where they exhibit thermoregulatory behaviours to increase body temperature during infection and has been observed in a vast range of distant species including reptiles, amphibians, fish, insects and crustaceans. When combined with traditional metabolic fever the conservation of febrile responses spans over 800 million years of evolution, illustrating the utility of studying fever from a comparative approach using ectothermic models. Many previous studies have displayed strikingly improved pathogen clearance and survival rates in these febrile animals, but few have dissected the mechanisms by which this is achieved. Previous studies using teleost models have shown that behavioural fever is capable of upregulating pro-inflammatory and antiviral gene expression, but none have assessed the impact of behavioural fever on functional immune responses. To address this gap in knowledge, I used a model of zymosan-induced peritonitis in goldfish to study the effect of behavioural fever on functional inflammatory responses. I found that zymosan injection promoted a behavioural fever consisting of a small increase in temperature preference but drastic decreases in velocity and temperature seeking behaviour, illustrating the use of other M-bM-^@M-^Xsickness behavioursM-bM-^@M-^Y to define febrile responses.  I found that when compared to fish held at normal 16M-BM-0C housing temperature, the ability to thermoregulate up to 26M-BM-0C promoted a rapid early influx of leukocytes, and particularly neutrophils, to the inflammatory site. This early cellular response may play an important role in controlling infections by engaging pathogens early before they can replicate to high levels. In addition, I found that behavioural fever caused the rapid reduction of peritoneal cells to homeostatic levels, but with elevated lymphocyte recruitment two-fold higher than controls. This places fever as an inducer and regulator of inflammation and also a possible regulator of downstream adaptive memory responses. When assessing the antimicrobial responses of inflammatory leukocytes, I found that behavioural fever prevents the high production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), but promotes the induction of inducible nitric oxide responses 24 h earlier than controls. This may play a role in promoting the elimination of pathogens while preventing oxidative tissue damage caused by extracellularly released ROS. In addition, while I found that behavioural fever does not inherently affect leukocytes phagocytic ability, increased ex vivo temperature was able to accelerate target internalization in cells derived from both febrile and non-febrile fish, indicating that febrile body temperature likely potentiates phagocytic responses in vivo. Interestingly, I found that manually increasing temperature did not replicate immune efficiencies seen in febrile fish, indicating that the regulation of temperature by each individual animal is critical to inducing febrile immunomodulatory effects. Using a live Aeromonas veronii furunculation infection model that mimics naturally occurring teleost infections, I found that thermoregulation promotes the rapid clearance of Aeromonas by 7 days (50%) earlier than controls, despite increasing growth rate of A. veronii cultures at higher temperatures, indicating that behavioural thermoregulation must modulate host immunity to overcome increased microbial replication rates. Behavioural thermoregulation promoted early iNOS expression, indicating that similar immune-modulatory mechanics were likely taking place within the live infection model. Behavioural thermoregulation also greatly reduced the pathology of induced furuncles and promoted rapid healing of infected lesions. This was associated with early expression of pro-resolution and healing factors IL-10 and VEG-F, indicating that thermoregulation also actively acts to protect host tissues and potentiate healing responses. Overall, my data shows that behavioural thermoregulation acts as a potent regulator of teleost inflammatory responses that drives the efficient induction of immune antimicrobial responses that also prevents host tissue damage while promoting tissue repair and an effective return to homeostasis. The ability to control body temperature appears to have evolved as a M-bM-^@M-^Xsword and shieldM-bM-^@M-^Y mechanism critical to the efficient clearance of a highly virulent pathogen but also acts to protect against host tissue damage while promoting wound healing to rapidly reach a state of functional tissue homeostasis." ;

    ns1:abstract "Epidermal Growth Factor-like domain 7 (EGFL7) is a secreted angiogenic factor that is almost exclusively expressed by endothelial cells. High EGFL7 expression occurs during physiological angiogenesis, under pathological conditions, and in solid tumor angiogenesis. Evidence suggests that EGFL7 expression is elevated in several human tumors, such as glioma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and colon cancer. EGFL7 is composed of three domains: an Emilin-like (EMI) domain, two Epidermal Growth Factor-like (EGF) repeats and a Matrilin-like (MAT) domain. While EGFL7 is a known regulator of physiological angiogenesis, little is known about its function in tumors. In this study, we attempted to clarify EGFL7M-bM-^@M-^Ys role in the regulation of tumor angiogenesis and its mechanism of action.  EGFL7 was stably expressed in HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells as either full length protein or as a mutant with one domain deleted per cell line (HT1080 EGFL7M-NM-^TEMI, HT1080 EGFL7M-NM-^TEGF and HT1080 EGFL7M-NM-^TMat). Cell proliferation was assessed using an MTT-based proliferation assay. A tumor growth assay and two angiogenesis assays were carried out to elucidate the effect of EGFL7 and its domains on angiogenic sprouting in tumors. Contrary to expectation, the cancer-specific expression of EGFL7 in fibrosarcoma cells led to the suppression of tumor growth in vivo. Importantly, there was no significant difference in their ability to proliferate in vitro. Both in vitro and ex ovo angiogenesis assay showed significant reduction in the vascular density for the EGFL7 overexpressing cells. Interestingly, both the reduction in tumor size and inhibition of angiogenesis were dependent upon the presence of the Emilin-like domain in EGFL7.  To study EGFL7M-bM-^@M-^Ys mechanism of action, EGFL7 from tumor cell lysates was immunoprecipitated using antibody coated protein-A beads and co-precipitated proteins were identified using western blotting. Integrin M-NM-21 and Thrombospondin-1 were discovered to be interacting partners for EGFL7 using this method.  Finally, extracellular vesicles (EVs) were isolated from enriched medium of HT1080 cells (Control, EGFL7 and deletion mutants) and analysed using flow cytometry, western blotting, TEM, and confocal imaging. EGFL7 was observed to be secreted via EVs from EGFL7-expressing cancer cells, as confirmed by the TEM imaging. Interestingly, deleting the EGF-like domain significantly reduced the number of EGFL7-expressing EVs that were released from cancer cells.  To summarize, EGFL7 is a potent inhibitor of tumor angiogenesis and its anti-angiogenic phenotype is medium ted via the Emilin-like domain. The EGF-like domain is also functional as it regulates the EV-mediated secretion of EGFL7 from cancer cells. Additionally, two important angiogenic mediators, Integrin M-NM-21 and Thrombospondin-1, were identified as protein interactors of the EGFL7 protein and may be involved in EGFL7M-bM-^@M-^Ys inhibition of tumor angiogenesis." ;

    ns2:abstract "Situated at the juncture of black periodical studies, periodical studies more broadly, the history of American journalism, and black womenM-bM-^@M-^Ys historiography, Professional Anxiety contributes to a growing trend in scholarship that explores black female journalistsM-bM-^@M-^Y writing. This study considers the meaning of professional legitimacy for African American women, and their complex work to claim it, in the press at the turn of the century. Focusing on leading black female journalists, including Gertrude Mossell, Victoria Earle Matthews, Mary Church Terrell, Ida B. Wells, Lucy Wilmot Smith, and Addie Hunton, I argue that their negotiation of professional standards is made evident through their writing on journalism and on the black domestic worker, a controversial figure within the black press and broader turn-of-the-century American society due to her centrality to such pressing issues as migration, education, labour, and civil rights. Whereas extant scholarship on middle-class black womenM-bM-^@M-^Ys writing on the black domestic worker often positions it as classist or emerging from social reform work and the black womenM-bM-^@M-^Ys club movement, I contend that for black female journalists addressing this figure constituted both an important strategy toward solidifying their tenuous claim to professional legitimacy even as they used it to challenge dominant notions of professionalism within journalism.  My project explores black female journalistsM-bM-^@M-^Y efforts to negotiate their marginalization by aligning themselves with legitimizing collectives while simultaneously working to redefine their roles within them. Chapter One examines the ways that, through their writing on the profession, they simultaneously upheld models of respectable journalism within the black press that promoted racial collectivity, yet undermined them by championing a careerist, feminist collectivity with other black female journalists, even over loyalty to M-bM-^@M-^\the race.M-bM-^@M-^] In the subsequent chapters, I build on this analysis by interrogating black female journalistsM-bM-^@M-^Y navigation of gendered and racialized meanings of professionalism, not only within the black press but also within American journalism, through their writing on the black domestic worker. In both Chapters Two and Three, I argue that this strategic negotiation of journalistic professionalism often came at the cost of creating a dichotomous relationship with black domestic workers that undermined their labour movement. I argue in Chapter Two that black female journalists endeavoured to rhetorically manage their proximity to this figure in order to construct themselves as informational journalists, a significant move given that this prestigious form of journalism was widely racialized as white and gendered as male. In Chapter Three, I read their engagement with the black domestic worker within the context of the M-bM-^@M-^\servant problemM-bM-^@M-^] debates as an attempt to lay claim to markers of professionalism, which were denied to them through systemic oppression, and yet were increasingly privileged in an era of professionalizing American journalism." ;

The effects of these chemical changes on the characteristics of the polyols for polyurethane preparation were studied. The reactive flame retardant canola oil based polyol was successfully replaced all of the polyol content used for the preparation of rigid polyurethane foams with biocontent of more than 90%. These were shown to have significantly improved flame retardancy and were self-extinguishing." ;

    ns3:abstract "With the goal to form stable, solid state tunable emitters at room temperature, the work within this thesis describes the synthesis of both symmetric and unsymmetric tellurophenes along with the study of their optoelectronic properties in solution and in the solid state. Chapter 2 describes the synthesis of a series of tetraborylated thiophenes, selenophenes and tellurophenes via transmetallation reactions. The optical properties of the series were studied by UV-vis spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry, as well as using theoretical calculations (TD DFT). Luminescence from tetraborylated/diborylated tellurophenes was studied under argon and in aerated conditions, given O2-dependent phosphorescence in solution and the solid state. Chapter 3 reports the synthesis of new borylated and bromide-functionalized tellurophenes via selective protodeboronation reactions of tetraborylated tellurophenes under thermal and microwave conditions and via exchange reactions using copper dibromide. The protodeboronation of tetraborylated chalcogenophenes (thiophene, selenophene and tellurophene) is described and their respective 3,4-diborylated products featured non-emissive properties in the solid state and in solution. It is expected that both new borylated and brominated tellurophenes will serve as building blocks for the further preparation of conjugated polymers. Chapter 4 features the synthesis of symmetric and unsymmetric aryl-tellurophenes through Suzuki-Miyaura and Sonogashira cross coupling reactions. The goal was to tune the phosphorescent properties via modification of the central tellurophene in the 2,5-positions with electron donating/withdrawing substituents. It was found that the electron withdrawing group, m-(CF3)2C6H3, attached to the tellurophene forms a couple acceptor-donor-acceptor with intense phosphorescent emission. This study showed the possibility of achieving phosphorescence using readily available di-arylated tellurophenes." ;

        "Sip1" ;
    ns1:abstract "Merlin and the ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) proteins are key organizers of the cell cortex through linking membrane-associated proteins to the underlying actin cytoskeleton. Merlin and the ERM proteins have been implicated in the maintenance of cell integrity, adhesion, and motility during tissue development and organization. Functional redundancies between the ERM proteins remain a challenge to further elucidating ERM protein function in mammals. Furthermore, the precise mechanisms underlying the tissue-specific defects associated with the loss of merlin still remain unclear. Thus, we use Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism to further investigate the functional significance of Merlin and Moesin, the single Drosophila orthologues of merlin and the ERM proteins.   Biochemical studies have demonstrated that mammalian merlin interacts with ezrin-binding phosphoprotein 50 (EBP50), which is an essential scaffold protein in ERM-mediated membrane organization. However, the functional significance of the merlin and EBP50 interaction still remains unclear. We used Drosophila as a model organism to further characterize the interaction between Merlin and Sip1, the Drosophila orthologue of EBP50. We found that Merlin and Sip1 genetically interact. In vitro binding assays showed that the M-NM-1-helical domain of Merlin was important for Sip1 binding. Specifically, mutation of two conserved arginine residues within the M-NM-1-helical domain of Merlin reduced binding to Sip1 and altered Merlin subcellular localization and trafficking in Drosophila wing epithelia and cell culture. When Merlin with reduced binding to Sip1 was expressed in the adult wings, the area of the wing region increased. Furthermore, reduced Merlin and Sip1 binding led to defects in epithelial organization in the follicle cell epithelium surrounding the developing oocyte. These findings suggest that Merlin and Sip1 binding is important for growth inhibition and epithelial organization in Drosophila.  As the loss of merlin is associated with the development of central nervous system tumours in humans, the functional significance of Drosophila Merlin was further investigated in a neuronal context. Within the Drosophila optic lobe, neuroepithelial cells differentiate into neural progenitors or neuroblasts, which give rise to the neurons essential for the adult visual system. Multiple signaling pathways have been linked to neuroepithelial cell proliferation and differentiation. We found that both Merlin and Sip1 localized to the neuroepithelial cells and neuroblasts within the developing optic lobe. Loss of Merlin and Sip1 led to defects in optic lobe development. Although the mechanisms still remain largely unknown, these findings suggest that Merlin and Sip1 may regulate neuroepithelial cell proliferation or differentiation.    Drosophila neuroblast asymmetric cell division requires an intact actomyosin network for anchoring polarity proteins to the cell cortex and maintaining cell size asymmetry. However, the mechanisms that regulate actomyosin dynamics during neuroblast asymmetric cell division have not been extensively studied. We found that Moesin is essential for neuroblast proliferation and mitotic progression in the developing brain. During metaphase, phosphorylated Moesin (p-Moesin) was enriched at the apical cortex and loss of Moesin led to defects in apical polarity maintenance and cortical stability. This asymmetric distribution of p-Moesin was regulated by components of the apical polarity complex. During early anaphase, p-Moesin remained enriched at the apical cortex, which appeared to contribute to asymmetric cortical extension and myosin basal furrow positioning. Therefore, our findings reveal Moesin as a novel apical polarity protein that drives cortical remodelling of dividing neuroblasts, essential for polarity maintenance and initial establishment of cell size asymmetry.   Together, this work provides further insight into the role of Merlin and Moesin in cell or tissue organization during Drosophila development." ;

        "Rituximab" ;
    ns4:abstract "Abstract B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) accounts for more than 90% of all adult cases of lymphomas and in most cases it is CD20 positive. B-cell NHL is usually treated by combination of conventional chemotherapeutics and the monoclonal antibody against CD20, rituximab. This combination regimen leads to severe side effects reducing the quality of life in lymphoma patients and/or forcing clinicians to use suboptimal doses of the medication. With current treatment, the survival of lymphoma patients is only around 50%. There is a need for the development of more effective and less toxic therapies for NHL.  Towards this goal, we pursued development and optimization of traceable CD20 targeted nano-carriers that can stay stable upon dilution in blood and potentially deliver a high payload of conventional chemotherapeutics preferentially to NHL cells, as compared to normal cells that do not express CD20. Such nano-carriers may be used for targeted therapy of CD20 positive malignant cells as well as following the progression of the disease. In this context, preparation of immune-mixed micelles was pursued through incubation of rituximab conjugated poly(ethylene glycol)-1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (PEG-DSPE) and methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(M-NM-5-caprolactone) (PEG-PCL) with degree of polymerization (DP) of 15 or 22 in the PCL block, or methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(M-NM-5-benzyl carboxylate-M-NM-5-caprolactone)  (PEO-PBCL)  with DP of 22 in the PBCL block. The effect of the hydrophobic block (PCL15, PCL22, and PBCL22) on the thermodynamic and kinetic stability of mixed micelles was then studied by dynamic light scattering. The mixed micelles were made traceable, by introducing Cy5.5 to rituximab, and/or conjugating Cy3 to propagyl capped PEO-PCL or PEO-PBCL. The uptake of plain versus rituximab modified mixed micelles by KG-15 (CD20+) and SUP-M2 cells (CD20-) was then evaluated by flowcytometry at emission wavelengths of 570 and 707 nm, for Cy3 and Cy5, respectively. Paclitaxel was loaded in mixed micelles; and itM-bM-^@M-^Ys in vitro release was evaluated. The in-vitro cytotoxicity of paclitaxel loaded micelles against KG-15 and SUP-M2 cells was measured by MTT assay.  Our data showed mixed micelles composed of PCL22 or PBCL22 to be thermodynamically and kinetically more stable than those with PCL15.  Accordingly, rituximab modified mixed micelles containing PCL22 or PBCL22 showed the highest percentage of Cy3/Cy5 double positive association with KG-15 cells. The interaction of the rituximab modified mixed micelles was significantly higher by KG-15 than SUP-M2 cells. Pre-incubation of KG-15 cells with free antibody eliminated this difference, confirming the involvement of CD20 mediated micellar uptake. Paclitaxel release from mixed micelles with PCL22 and PBCL22 core was slower than that of PCL15.  The in-vitro cytotoxicity study showed no significant difference in the cytotoxic effect of paclitaxel loaded rituximab mixed micelles compared to paclitaxel loaded in plain mixed micelles in KG-15 and SUP-M2 cells at 24 and 72 h, however, perhaps reflecting the non-internalizing function of CD20 receptor. In summary, the results of this study showed successful development of traceable immune-mixed micelles for active targeting of B-cell NHL based on rituximab-PEG-DSPE and PEO-PCL22 or PEO-PBCL22. Mixed micelles of PEO-PCL15 were found to be not stable enough for this purpose." ;

    ns3:abstract "NPAS3 encodes a transcription factor of the bHLH-PAS family, which has been robustly associated with neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders with intellectual disability as a common feature. NPAS3 was initially discovered as a schizophrenia-associated gene in a family with a translocation breaking only NPAS3. Since then, deletions encompassing NPAS3 have been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders such as holoprosencephaly, holoprosencephaly microforme and Sotos syndrome. SNPs linked to, and within, NPAS3 have been associated with neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, as well as antipsychotic responsiveness. A common feature of all of these disorders is intellectual disability. Deletion of NPAS3 in mice results in marked behavioural and neuroanatomical phenotypes reminiscent of neuropsychiatric disorders, including increased anxiety, altered behavior and deficits in learning and memory. Further, deficits in neurodevelopment in utero resulting in reduced interneuron number, smaller cortical volume, increased ventricles and altered cerebellar foliation, as well as deficits in adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, have been observed. Despite the robustness of the evidence that NPAS3 is associated with neuropsychological function and neuropsychiatric dysfunction, its molecular function is not well characterized.  Here, I set out to functionally characterize NPAS3 as a transcription factor of the bHLH-PAS family. I assessed its ability to interact with its presumed obligate heterodimeric partner, ARNT, as well as its ability to directly bind and regulate genes it has been found to genetically regulate. I have determined that NPAS3 does functionally interact with ARNT to regulate two target genes directly: VGF and TXNIP, both of which have functions relevant to cell survival and neuronal functions. Through the assays developed to characterize NPAS3 function, I have characterized the function of its predicted domains and found them to participate in DNA binding, protein::protein interaction and transactivation, consistent with the categorization of NPAS3 as a bHLH-PAS transcription factor. Assessment of NPAS3 function at the cellular level was performed and NPAS3 expression at the mRNA level was found to respond to soluble factors, as well as cell contact, suggesting a role of NPAS3 in environmental response.  As the disorders with which NPAS3 has been associated share a common feature of intellectual disability, a collaborative study was undertaken to assess the contribution of NPAS3 variation to normal variation in neurocognition in order to understand its role in neuropsychological function, both normal and disordered. To that end, we have assessed the contribution of exonic variation of NPAS3 to cognitive function in a cross-sectional population of Western Canadian young adults. The minor alleles of a three SNP haplotype within exon 12 of NPAS3 were found to be associated with worse performance on a test of verbal working memory, and a trend was observed with generally reduced cognitive function, as assessed by the Screen for Cognitive Impairment in Psychiatry. Taken together, these data expand our understanding of the role of NPAS3 in normal cognitive functioning and neuropsychiatric dysfunction. NPAS3 has been found to directly regulate two genes with roles in neuronal survival, stress/injury response and metabolic balance. These data support the role of NPAS3 in the survival of proliferating neuroprogenitors during neurodevelopment and neurogenic processes, which can be predicted to contribute to the intellectual disability observed when NPAS3 expression is reduced or lost." ;

    ns3:abstract "Within diseases such as coronary artery disease (CAD) and peripheral artery disease (PAD) ischemia is induced in tissues due to arterial accumulation of atherosclerotic plaque. A novel therapeutic approach to restore blood flow is to neutralize anti-angiogenic factors that could limit ischemia-induced angiogenesis. Angiostatin is a potent anti-angiogenic factor that reduces endothelial cell migration, proliferation, and survival due to inhibition of an adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase localized on the surface of endothelial cells. Importantly, angiostatin inhibits lung endothelial cell expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and membrane-bound MMP, MT1-MMP specifically during hypoxia; these MMPs are important mediators of endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis. Angiostatin may also contribute to endothelial dysfunction and impaired angiogenic responses by decreasing endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) as observed in hypoxic lung endothelial cells. Overall, the anti-angiogenic effects of angiostatin can create a poor microenvironment for neovascularization of hypoxic tissues, thereby potentially contributing to the pathology of ischemic vascular diseases. The hypoxic-specific effects of angiostatin on cardiac-derived endothelial cells were investigated in vitro, while its effect on angiogenesis in vivo was investigated in a hind limb ischemia (HLI) model. Finally, a study to selectively neutralize angiostatin to restore the MMP-mediated angiogenic response of cardiac-derived cells was performed. Aims: 1. To investigate if angiostatin inhibits MMP-2 and eNOS levels in cardiac-derived human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC-C), cells were incubated for 48 hours in normoxic or hypoxic (95% N2, 5% CO2) conditions. Gelatin zymography and western blot were used to analyze MMP-2 and eNOS protein levels, respectively. 2. To investigate if administering angiostatin (30M-NM-<g) intraperitoneally in transgenic eNOS-GFP mice will impair angiogenesis in a HLI model. 3. To determine if neutralizing angiostatin (600nM) using ATP synthase M-NM-1 and M-NM-2 subunits (3M-NM-<M) will restore MMP-2 levels and HMVEC-C migration during hypoxia. MMP-2 protein expression was analyzed via gelatin zymography. A modified Boyden chamber assay was utilized to measure HMVEC-C migration. 4. To determine if the ATP synthase subunits interfere with fibrinolysis in vitro, clot formation and breakdown was induced in human platelet-poor plasma via incubation with thrombin (1U/ml) and tissue plasminogen activator (1M-oM-^AM--g/ml) in the presence of the ATP synthase M-NM-1, M-NM-2 and M-NM-4 subunits (3M-NM-<M). Results: Angiostatin decreased MMP-2 and eNOS protein expression in hypoxic HMVEC-C. In a HLI model, angiostatin-administrated mice exhibited significantly reduced blood perfusion recovery at day 14, and reduced eNOS-GFP and MMP-2 expression in ischemic tissue in comparison to control mice. Hypoxic HMVEC-C co-treated with angiostatin and the ATP synthase M-NM-1 subunit exhibited increased MMP-2 expression compared to angiostatin alone. Furthermore, hypoxic HMVEC-C co-treated with angiostatin and the ATP synthase M-NM-1 subunit exhibited an average increase in MMP-dependent migration compared to angiostatin alone. Lastly, at concentrations used to neutralize angiostatin (3M-oM-^AM--M), the ATP synthase subunits did not interfere with fibrinolysis in vitro. Conclusions: During hypoxia, angiostatin reduced HMVEC-C expression of angiogenic mediators, MMP-2 and eNOS, which may be how it exerts its anti-angiogenic effects within an ischemic environment. In a murine HLI model, angiostatin impaired angiogenesis. Finally, neutralizing angiostatin using the ATP synthase M-NM-1 subunit increased MMP-2 expression in HMVEC-C, and resulted in an increase in endothelial cell migration all at a concentration that does not interfere with fibrinolysis. Therefore, using the ATP synthase M-NM-1 subunit to neutralize angiostatin could be a potential novel strategy to promote therapeutic angiogenesis." ;

    ns2:subject "Ubiquitin, SUMO, RAP80, NMR" ;
    ns1:abstract "The information contained in our genome is essential for the proper functioning of different physiological processes in cells that are required for our growth and survival, making the maintenance of genome integrity a task of utmost priority. Our cells have evolved a highly elaborate, complex and well regulated process of DNA repair that accompanies cell cycle regulation, chromatin remodeling and transcription of repair proteins, collectively known as, DNA damage response. Amidst different kinds of DNA damage, double strand breaks pose a serious threat to the cell survival, however most of the time these breaks are repaired by Non Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) or Homologous Recombination (HR). HR involves the end resection of broken DNA strands followed by a homology search, DNA synthesis and the ligation of the broken strand. The end resection of the broken DNA strand is a special feature of the HR process, which is precisely controlled by many factors and performed by proteins such as CtIP and the MRN complex. RAP80, a DNA repair protein was initially believed to promote HR over NHEJ by recruiting proteins to DNA damage sites that favor end resection, such as BRCA1 that forms a multi protein complex with Abraxas, BRCC36, BARD1 and RAP80, known as BRCA1 A complex. BRCA1, a major player of the DNA repair pathway is a crucial tumor suppressor protein whose mutations show strong links to breast and ovarian cancer. Recent advances suggest that although RAP80 recruits BRCA1 to the DNA damage sites, eventually it represses HR by sequestering BRCA1 within the complex and restricting its association with other complexes that endorse end resection. This decisive role played by RAP80 in the repair pathway choice is due to its ability to recognize Lys-63 linked ubiquitin chains and SUMO moieties through its ubiquitin and SUMO interacting motifs present at the N-terminal region. A single deletion mutation in the ubiquitin interacting motif of RAP80 has been linked with cases of familial breast cancer. Additionally, a mutation in the SUMO interacting motif of RAP80 has been linked to somatic mutations in cancer cells, highlighting the importance of ubiquitin and SUMO recognition in genome protection. We employed NMR spectroscopy, binding studies, stability studies and MD simulations to understand the molecular basis of ubiquitin and SUMO recognition of RAP80. We demonstrate that the M-NM-^TE81 mutation in the first ubiquitin interacting motif of RAP80 leads to a structural frameshift of the helix with causing modest changes in the stability. The prominent reason for the impaired binding of this mutant with ubiquitin is its loss of favourable electrostatic interaction, resulting in a loss of multivalent binding advantage.    We also determine the binding affinity of the SUMO interacting motif of RAP80 with SUMO-2 using NMR methods and show that the phosphorylation of RAP80 by casein kinase 2 enhances its affinity for SUMO-2 by ~25 fold due to increased electrostatic interactions between the phosphorylated serine residues and the basic loop of SUMO-2 present at the binding site. Understanding these binding interactions from a structural and thermodynamic point of view is fundamental in order to develop a holistic understanding of the ubiquitin and SUMO recognition process. Our research has provided a closer look at the critical interactions in ubiquitin and SUMO signaling in DNA repair and has opened up new avenues for future research in DNA repair field." ;

Among the twenty six phenolic compounds tested in this study, butyl gallate, octyl gallate, lauryl gallate, propyl gallate, naringenin and quercetin exhibited the most potent antimicrobial activity in L. monocytogenes with minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) lower than 512 M-NM-<g/ml. Butyl gallate was the only phenolic compound that exhibited synergistic inhibitory activity against all tested strains of L. monocytogenes in combination with nisin. In addition, nisin showed anti-biofilm activity against L. monocytogenes ATCC 19115 at concentrations as low as 10 IU/ml. Naringenin, propyl gallate, octyl gallate and lauryl gallate at concentrations as low as 5 M-NM-<g/ml increased the anti-biofilm activity of nisin at10 IU/ml. The enhanced anti-biofilm activity of nisin in combination with naringenin, propyl gallate, octyl gallate and lauryl gallate were also observed in different strains of L. monocytogenes. Fluorescent microscopic imaging demonstrated that biofilm formation by L. monocytogenes ATCC 19115 was inhibited in the presence of nisin alone, and with nisin and naringenin. These results suggest that phenolic compounds can be used as effective adjuvant to increase the ant-listerial and anti-biofilm activity of nisin." ;

    ns5:abstract "In recent years, there has been a renewed interest in using bacteriophages as an alternate agent for the treatment of multi-drug resistant bacteria. One such highly drug-resistant group of bacteria is the Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc), which causes chronic infections in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Bcc consist of twenty-two Gram-negative species that are especially problematic because of their person-to-person transmissibility and an ability to generate a rapidly fatal acute infection. Presently, phage therapy is being developed as an alternative treatment for Bcc infections. However, for phage therapy to be most effective, strategies to enhance efficacy of treatment need to be explored. One of the methods we examined was the synergistic effect of certain antibiotics on Bcc phages KS12 and KS14. Phage-Antibiotic Synergy (PAS) was observed for both of the phages as noted by increases in phage plaque sizes and phage titers. A significant increase in the survival of Bcc-infected Galleria mellonella larvae was observed when treated with meropenem or minocycline in combination with phage, as compared to phage or antibiotics alone. Another strategy examined was to test the effects of phage-encoded MazG on phage production. MazG is a pyrophosphohydrolase which can hydrolyse GTP and ATP. MazG encoded by Bcc phages KL1 and AH2 was tested on phage production in overnight cultures of B. cenocepacia C6433 and K56-2. Significantly higher numbers of phages were observed upon infection of stationary phase Bcc cells transformed with cloned KL1 or AH2 mazG. This indicates that MazG can provide an advantage to phages infecting slow-growing Bcc bacteria, which likely exist in stationary phase during chronic infections. These findings suggest that different strategies can be employed to increase the activity of phages and thus can be used to enhance the efficacy of phage treatment." ;

    ns2:abstract "The M-bM-^@M-^\democratic nation-buildingM-bM-^@M-^] project implemented in Iraq after the American-led invasion and occupation in 2003 has failed by any measure of the concept. The country is unstable; the central government does not provide social services or security. The Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) destroyed Mosul, IraqM-bM-^@M-^Ys second largest city, endangering the very existence of Iraq as a sovereign state. Even worse, Iraqis not only seem to have little to no faith in their governing elites, but increasingly find them culpable in the violence, which has taken over their lives since the invasion of 2003. Iraqi national identity is fragmented along tribal, ethnic, and religious lines due to the sectarianization of the state, which began under the occupation. Finally, the violence has resulted in a refugee crisis but also drastically changed the demographics of Iraq, homogenizing neighbourhoods that were once diverse. This reality on the ground facilitates the question that underlines this study: why has the M-bM-^@M-^\democratic nation-buildingM-bM-^@M-^] project in Iraq failed since the US-led regime change in 2003 until 2016?  Much of the conventional literature on post-invasion Iraq has focused on the twin concepts of M-bM-^@M-^\democratizationM-bM-^@M-^] and M-bM-^@M-^\nation-building.M-bM-^@M-^] Specifically, this literature sought solutions for the problem of re-building Iraq M-bM-^@M-^S as opposed to the problem of the invasion and occupation M-bM-^@M-^S and largely focused on endogenous factors such as power-sharing, consociational democracy, M-bM-^@M-^\ethnically divided societies,M-bM-^@M-^] and M-bM-^@M-^\sectarianism.M-bM-^@M-^] In contrast, this dissertation identifies and seeks to address two underdeveloped elements in the literature; first, analyses of post-2003 Iraq have broadly focused on the problem of sectarianism as an impediment to the democratization of Iraq, which implies that Iraqis are inherently unable to live together in one state. This literature has largely, aside from some critical voices, ignored the role played by the invasion, occupation, international and regional politics. Second, these studies on nation-building have predominantly focused on unrepresentative elites and a top-down approach to democratization. This is problematic because there has not been enough attention paid to Iraqi voices and their visions of democracy. There is also not much attention paid to the fact that US nation-building efforts in 2003, much like their British predecessors following the First World War, have largely excluded representative Iraqis from forging their own political future. Subsequently, this research uses critical postcolonial/decolonial, M-bM-^@M-^\history from below,M-bM-^@M-^] and subaltern approaches. It does so, in part, to demonstrate a reciprocal and dialectical relationship between international and domestic politics in Iraq by problematizing the invasion and occupation. This is achieved through using critical discourse analysis to challenge the top-down, elite-driven model of M-bM-^@M-^\democraticM-bM-^@M-^] nation-building imposed on post-2003 Iraq. In addition, this research seeks to explore the potential for democratization M-bM-^@M-^\from belowM-bM-^@M-^] by examining Iraqi articulations of the state. To that end, I accessed the Hizb al-BaM-bM-^@M-^Yth al- M-bM-^@M-^XArabi al-Ishtiraki (BaM-bM-^@M-^Yath Party of Iraq) Collection at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University. I also conducted nine semi-structured interviews with Iraqis experts and civil society practitioners in March and April of 2016. These research participants were selected due to their expertise in democratization, Iraq and their direct or indirect involvement with the state-building project in post-2003 Iraq. In addition, I consciously used the work of critical Iraqi scholars to discuss post-2003 Iraq, especially with regards to the violence, the occupation and its legacies and sectarianism to provide a counter-story to the conventional narrative on post-2003 Iraq. Together, this data not only strongly challenges the dominant narrative on post-2003 Iraq but also offers a more nuanced and comprehensive understanding of Iraqi society, sectarian relations, and politics.  The major contribution of this research is the inclusion of Iraqi voices and primary materials to understand what went wrong in post-2003 Iraq. One of the biggest lessons Iraq teaches us is the limitations of a top-down, unrepresentative model of democratization imposed through a foreign invasion and occupation. This affirms the importance of research that examines the potential for a bottom-up, grassroots model of democratization." ;

        "Respiration" ;
    ns6:abstract "Gram-negative bacteria are separated from the environment by a multilayered structure known as the envelope, which is comprised of the outer membrane, the inner membrane and the aqueous periplasmic space that lies between the two membranes. Biogenesis of the envelope is a complex process that requires the coordinated activity of several different processes. To maintain a contiguous barrier, Escherichia coli utilize several signal transduction pathways that sense and mediate adaptation to defects in envelope biogenesis or envelope integrity. One such pathway is the Cpx envelope stress response, which mediates adaptation to stresses that affect protein folding within the envelope. To alleviate protein-folding stress, the Cpx response activates the transcription of several envelope-localized chaperones and proteases while also repressing the expression of macromolecular envelope protein complexes. While it is clear that regulation of chaperones and proteases would generate an effective adaptive response to misfolded proteins, the role of multisubunit protein complexes in this process is not yet known. Recent analysis of the Cpx regulon in enteropathogenic E. coli suggests that the Cpx response inhibits the expression of several respiratory complexes of the aerobic electron transport chain. The purpose of this thesis was to better understand the role of respiration in the Cpx envelope stress response, with a focus on the primary dehydrogenase NADH dehydrogenase I and terminal oxidase cytochrome bo3. First, we provide evidence to suggest that the Cpx response regulates expression of these complexes at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. Transcription of the genes encoding both complexes is directly repressed by the Cpx response. Furthermore, we found that activation of the Cpx response increases proteolysis of both NADH dehydrogenase I and cytochrome bo3 in a manner that may involve the zinc metalloprotease FtsH. We also show that regulation of these complexes facilitates adaptation to several stresses that activate the Cpx response. Next, we investigated the relationship of respiration to the stress that is sensed by the Cpx response. We found that both NADH dehydrogenase I and cytochrome bo3 contribute to basal levels of Cpx pathway activity, but are not required for activation of the Cpx response by overproduction of the outer-membrane lipoprotein NlpE or through mutation of the inner membrane protease HtpX. However, we found that respiration may play a role in activation of the Cpx response in E. coli lacking tolC, which encodes the outer membrane channel of multidrug efflux systems. We found that deletion of tolC activates the Cpx response through accumulation of the siderophores and that this decreases activity of the NADH-dependent aerobic electron transport chain. We provide evidence to suggest that enterobactin accumulation disrupts heme biosynthesis and that this may disrupt biogenesis of respiratory complexes. Finally, we have found that the Cpx response inhibits expression of genes involved in enterobactin biosynthesis. The results presented in this thesis make a significant contribution to the study of envelope biogenesis in gram-negative bacteria. We believe that activation of the Cpx response reduces expression of envelope-localized macromolecular protein complexes to prevent damage to the inner membrane. These data provide support for the hypothesis that the Cpx response functions to monitor and maintain the integrity of the inner membrane." ;

    ns3:abstract "In this thesis we present Particle-in-Cell (PIC) plasma simulations designed to model large amplitude whistler waves. There are significant nonlinear effects that arise due wave-wave and wave-particle interactions. There are two related sections to this report: one investigating the evolution of the nonlinear dynamics of obliquely propagating whistler waves, and the other investigating the wave-wave coupling between whistler waves and electrostatic modes.   Recent satellite observations by \\textit{Cattell et al. (2008)}~\\cite{cattell2008} have identified the presence of large amplitude whistler plasma waves in the Earth's outer radiation belt ($3 \\leq L \\leq 15$) that propagate obliquely with respect to the Earth's magnetic field. \\textit{Cattell et al. (2008)} suggest that these large amplitude whistlers are a mechanism for the rapid acceleration of radiation belt electrons to relativistic energies. Previous efforts have been made in \\textit{Yoon (2011)}~\\cite{yoon2011} to simulate these large amplitude whistlers and the resulting particle acceleration using a cold electron fluid model with test particles in the nonlinear wave fields. Additionally, nonlinear effects such as particle trapping in \\textit{Kellogg et al. (2010)}~\\cite{kellogg2010} and wave steepening in \\textit{Yoon (2011)} have been identified as being important to the wave dynamics. We present results from a PIC simulation with self-consistent electromagnetic fields to account for the feedback effects of particles on the large amplitude whistler wave. Using initial conditions to launch a large amplitude plasma wave that is consistent with the dispersion relation for oblique whistler waves we characterize the nonlinear effects in the wave evolution. We show that the wave fields are capable of thermalizing a self-consistent electron distribution from $\\sim 1~\\textrm{eV}$ to $\\sim 100~\\textrm{eV}$, and can accelerate a non-interacting seed population from $\\sim 100~\\textrm{eV}$ into the range of $\\sim 20-30~\\textrm{keV}$. We highlight the presence of compressional wave steepening effects as well as particle trapping and wave field distortion and damping that follow thereafter. Finally, we present wave amplitude scaling relations for three important time scales: wave steepening time, particle trapping time, and particle acceleration time.   The second set of simulations revolve around a satellite observation by \\textit{Agapitov et al. (2015)}~\\cite{agapitov2015} of the parametric decay of a whistler wave into a backscattered whistler and an electron acoustic wave. It is claimed that this process is the source of spiked electrostatic fields in the outer radiation belt observed by \\textit{Mozer et al. (2013)}~\\cite{mozerTDS} that have been shown by \\textit{Artemyev et al. (2014)}~\\cite{artemyevTDS} to rapidly accelerate $\\sim 10-100~\\textrm{eV}$ electron populations into the $\\sim 1-2~\\textrm{keV}$ range. We present a set of Darwin PIC simulations investigating the interactions of parallel electromagnetic whistler waves with electrostatic plasma modes. By adding external wave fields consistent with the whistler dispersion to the self consistent electromagnetic fields we launch a whistler wave in different plasma conditions to isolate interactions with the Langmuir, ion acoustic, and electron acoustic wave modes. We identify a nonlinear coupling to the Langmuir mode that results in nonlinear electrostatic structures and modification to the electron velocity distribution at the whistler phase velocity. With moving ions we present multiple parametric decay channels of a whistler into a backscattered whistler and ion acoustic mode that show remarkable agreement with predictions made using a simple ponderomotive force as the coupling mechanism. However, a similar process does not occur for the electron acoustic mode as the Langmuir coupling dominates in this scenario. Drawing from the ion acoustic results and the conditions in \\textit{Agapitov et al. (2015)} we suggest that it may be necessary to have a relative drift between hot and cold electron populations to observe the parametric decay of a whistler wave into an electron acoustic wave in space plasma conditions." ;

    ns4:abstract "In North America, opera constitutes both an art form and an industry. Because companies rely on philanthropy and ticket revenues, they respond to a mass audience among the public at large, and yet granting agenciesM-bM-^@M-^Y and criticsM-bM-^@M-^Y influence suggests restricted circulation and in some ways a M-bM-^@M-^\highM-bM-^@M-^] culture status. OperaM-bM-^@M-^Ys multifaceted performance practices and its contradictory social roles in North America are reflected in the diverse disciplines currently engaging in its study. Critical musicology has, since the early 1990s, increasingly studied operatic texts through theoretical lenses of post-structuralism (Levin, Kramer) feminism (McClary), psychoanalysis (Abbate) and musical dramaturgy (Bianconi). More recently, issues of prominence include digital contexts of performance and composition (Morris, Michaels) and indigeneity (Karantonis, Robinson). Literary scholars have examined issues of adaptation and intertextuality (Lindenberger, Hutcheon, Wiesenthal). Historians have investigated the business of opera (Preston, Dizikes), and social science approaches, especially those related to BourdieuM-bM-^@M-^Ys formative study Distinction, focus on the relationships between the art form and its audiences (Calhoun, Benzecry, Johnson). As a richly multidisciplinary field, opera studies follows, in general, two trends. The first treats the opera score or performance context as its object of study, and the second focuses on political or social circumstances of opera production in specific historical periods or geographic locations. This study investigates the boundaries between these approaches. It takes as its primary archive the circulation of opera in North America in the twentieth century: within live performance, mediated through recording and broadcasting, and adapted into popular contexts far removed from the opera house. It posits contemporary opera circulation as a site of aesthetic and social negotiation in North America, traceable through the intertwined histories of opera and emergent media in the twentieth century.  Using methods of media genealogy (Gitelman, Parikka), circulation (Warner, Povinelli and Gaonkar) and cultural theory (Williams, Appadurai) this study proposes the concept of M-bM-^@M-^\operascapeM-bM-^@M-^] to account for the circulation of specific opera texts, and the impacts of that circulation on the broader public culture of North America. Treating opera as multi-form media frames its musical, dramatic and performance facets in the context of the related, reified social activities that have developed over time. These M-bM-^@M-^\protocolsM-bM-^@M-^] include publicsM-bM-^@M-^Y investments in celebrity culture, the primacy of the voice, attentiveness, and negotiations around expertise; they are archived in the early histories of mass media throughout the twentieth century. As industries of recording and broadcasting emerged in North America, they relied upon opera in a number of ways to make their new media desirable for potential consumers. This long-standing media-opera relationship impacts repertoire decisions, casting, and communications practices in the opera industry today. It also resonates throughout contemporary cultural production beyond opera." ;

    ns6:abstract "Microtubule dynamics is regulated by naturally occurring microtubule-associated proteins occurring in the cellular environment as well as by natural and synthetic compounds. These compounds target the microtubule cytoskeleton and serve as anti-mitotic drugs. Therefore, microtubules continue to be one of the most effective targets for developing new anti-mitotic agents.  Laulimalide is one such anti-mitotic agent that was isolated from the marine sponge, Cacospongia mycofijiensis. Laulimalide has been shown to disrupt microtubules in a manner similar to paclitaxel, by causing bundling of microtubules and inducing microtubule stabilization. However, the acute effects of laulimalide on microtubules and its mode of action are unclear. The C. elegans embryo is an excellent model to characterize microtubule-targeted drugs, and herein, I report the first analysis of laulimalide in this system. My work indicates that laulimalide induces a concentration-dependent, biphasic change in microtubule polymer dynamics in the embryo. This analysis provides novel information about the acute in vivo effects of laulimalide on the microtubule polymer and helps distinguish this anti-mitotic drug from the widely-used chemotherapeutic paclitaxel.  In the C. elegans embryo, CYK-1 formin is required for a late step in cytokinesis. Based on the localization of CYK-1, it has been proposed to function in cytokinesis by bridging microtubules and microfilaments at the cleavage furrow. This bridging role of CYK-1 could stabilize the cytokinetic cleavage furrow by binding to spindle microtubules at the mid-zone on one side and actin, which is associated with the plasma membrane, on the other side. CYK-1 has also been implicated in cortical functions prior to cytokinesis, suggesting that it has a more global role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton. Using live-cell imaging and reverse-genetics, I found that depletion of CYK-1 resulted in exaggerated spindle pole oscillations during anaphase in the one-cell C. elegans embryo, suggesting that CYK-1 normally limits cortical forces in the embryo. UV laser-induced ablation of the cortex during mitosis showed that cyk-1 contributes to an increase in cortical rigidity. Thus, the effect of cyk-1 on spindle forces was likely due to changes in cortical elasticity.  Additional experiments involving known components of the G-protein coupled cortical force generators also indicated that cyk-1 likely does not alter cortical forces by modulating this pathway directly. This work contributes additional insight into how microtubules and the actin cytoskeleton coordinately modulate spindle forces during asymmetric cell division." ;

    ns4:abstract "Medium-sized cyclic ether and amine motifs often constitute the framework of a variety of natural products with interesting biological activities. As a result, the construction of these heterocycles is an important subject in organic synthesis, which has triggered the development of many strategies. The Stevens [1,2]-shift of sulfonium ylides is a versatile way to form new CM-bM-^@M-^SC bonds, which could be applied in the synthesis of medium-sized heterocycles.  Chapter 1 is a review of recent developments on the generation of sulfonium ylides from metallocarbenes and sulfur nucleophiles and their subsequent transformations, including [2,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement, Stevens [1,2]-shift and S-H insertion. Background information on the metallocarbene generation via decomposition of diazocarbonyl compound is also discussed. However, synthetic applications using the Stevens [1,2]-shift of sulfonium ylides were under explored, which intrigued our investigation in this area.  A novel approach to medium-sized cyclic ethers was previously developed by the West group using a Stevens [1,2]-shift of a sulfonium ylide derived from a readily accessible six membered monothioacetal precursor. Chapter 2 provides a detailed discussion on an application of this methodology as the key step in an enantioselective formal synthesis of (+)-laurencin. The concise and efficient transformation offers a surprising degree of chirality transfer with observed retention of stereochemical configuration on the migrating carbon. The resulting sulfur bridge could be efficiently removed by reductive desulfurization.  An extension to this strategy to access medium-sized cyclic amines is described in Chapter 3. The substituted thiazolidine ring with a diazoketoester tether was prepared from readily available starting materials. Although the resulting diastereomeric products could not be separated, when they were subjected to the Stevens rearrangement conditions, the desired sulfur-bridged azepine was obtained in quantitative yield. This promising result proved the feasibility of the methodology. Additional investigation is currently in progress to study the stereoselectivity of this transformation. In the future, this methodology could be applied as the key step to synthesize Stemona alkaloids, such as stemoamide." ;

    ns3:abstract "Increasingly stringent environmental regulations for the sulfur content in fuels pose significant technological challenges for refineries. Current single-stage hydrodesulfurization (HDS) technologies are not efficient enough to achieve ultra-deep levels of sulfur, 10 ppmw S for transportation, under non-severe operating conditions. Platinum-group catalysts in the second stage HDS require high hydrogen pressure, which increases capital and operational expenses. Despite a great progress, development of more efficient heterogeneous catalysts for both first and second stage HDS units using earth-abundant elements is still a challenge of paramount importance.  Palladium (Pd) has shown outstanding performance in HDS of refractory sulfur compound 4,6-DMDBT through hydrogenation of aromatic ring. However, Pd is very scarce and sinters in high-temperature applications, which deactivates the catalysts and alters selectivity. The thermal stability of palladium was enhanced in this thesis through the formation of bimetallic nanostructures with yttrium, as a sintering-resistant element, via colloidal synthesis method. The addition of yttrium did not alter the overall HDS rate but doubled the ratio of direct desulfurization (DDS) to hydrogenation (HYD) selectivity and suppressed cracking twice as much as monometallic palladium catalyst did. This enabled the HDS process to be operated at a pressure as low as 1 MPa. The above-mentioned improvements were not achieved by the conventional impregnation synthesis method.    As another alternative to the second-stage HDS catalysts, palladium species were reduced on the surface of colloidal iron (oxide) cores as nanosized islands using galvanic exchange reaction. The synergism between palladium species and iron oxide nanoparticles resulted in a four-fold enhancement in Pd-mass-based HDS activity at a reduced palladium loading. Pd dispersion and its HDS activity were maximized at the Pd/Fe molar ratio of 0.2. The incorporation of iron also improved the sulfur resistance of hydrogenation sites due to the higher affinity of sulfur to Fe as compared to Pd.   For the first-stage HDS, niobium sulfide (NbS2) is proposed that is more abundant and intrinsically more active than MoS2 and WS2 catalysts in HDS, hydrodenitrogenation, and hydrocracking reactions. However, the formation of NbS2 via sulfidation of niobium oxides needs a high temperature above 700 M-BM-0C due to the positive Gibbs free energy of sulfidation. It was shown for the first time that copper reduced the sulfidation/reduction temperature of Nb2O5 dramatically that consequently enhanced the HDS activity. The highest HDS activity of bulk NbCu catalysts prepared via coprecipitation technique was achieved at Cu/Nb molar ratio of 0.3. Copper also promoted DDS and HYD selectivities and suppressed hydrocracking.  The strong interaction between Nb2O5 and oxide supports such as alumina makes the sulfidation of niobium oxide more difficult than that of bulk material. Among different support materials, carbon and alpha-alumina exhibited higher activities per mole of Nb and carbon support delivered the highest mass-based activity. Raman spectroscopy showed that various niobium oxides formed on the carbon support at different Nb loadings (from 2.0 to 12.0 wt%) exhibiting different sulfidation and catalytic behaviors. Niobium species at low loading (2.0 wt% Nb) showed the least sulfidation degree functioning as coordinatively unsaturated Lewis acid sites. This delivered the highest HDS activity per mole of Nb and an unprecedented hydrocracking selectivity of 71 % at 74 % conversion. Copper reduced sulfidation/reduction temperature of niobium oxide, improved the DDS selectivity, and reduced the hydrocracking selectivity to around 15 % over the entire Nb loadings.  Colloidal synthesis methodology is a powerful technique to control the size and shape of nanostructures in a liquid phase. NbS2 nanostructures in different shapes such as nanosheets, nanohexagons, nanobars, and nanospheres were prepared in the liquid phase at a low temperature of 300 M-BM-0C in the presence of (non-)coordinating solvent and capping ligand. The developed NbS2 nanostructures showed different catalytic behaviors in HDS of DBT depending on their shapes. The highest HDS activity and DDS selectivity were obtained on nanohexagons with abundant corner and edge active sites. This structure was twice more active than carbon-supported NbS2." ;

The dissertation traces how the contemporary Anglo-Canadian road genre maps a recalibrated sense of Canadian identity as Canadians adapted to shifting American-Canadian relations in the post-WWII period. I read the Trans-Canada HighwayM-bM-^@M-^Tand the road narrative that results from the construction of that highwayM-bM-^@M-^Tas a signal for the decreasing distance of Canada from the United States, particularly in relation to industrial-production capacities, capitalist economy, and liberal-democratic rights in the post-WWII period. Accordingly, I argue that the contemporary Anglo-Canadian road narrative mediates between affective attachments to the Canadian nationM-bM-^@M-^Twhether expressed through spatial relations, historical relations, or narratives of economic advancementM-bM-^@M-^Tand anxieties over the deterritorializing and denationalizing potential of this closer relation with the United States and with American ideals. While the effects of America on Canadian identity have been variously analyzed, particularly in relation to the field of border studies (e.g. Angus; Berland; McLuhan; Roberts; Siemerling and Phillips Casteel; Wyile), my dissertation argues for a more genealogical approach to this study of Canadian identity; an approach realized by mapping shifting aesthetics from the post-WWII period to our contemporary moment. While the first chapter of M-bM-^@M-^\Open Border, Open RoadM-bM-^@M-^] traces the development of Trans-Canada Highway signification through tourism marginalia and travelogues from the 1950s and 60s, my dissertation more broadly analyzes Anglo-Canadian road fiction according to three periods of American-Canadian relations: the economic nationalism period of the late 1960s and early 1970s, the free-trade era beginning in the 1980s, and the era of the Anthropocene. Regarding the chapter on CanadaM-bM-^@M-^Ys period of economic nationalism, for instance, I evaluate three textsM-bM-^@M-^TGlenn GouldM-bM-^@M-^Ys short story and radio documentary M-bM-^@M-^\The Search for Pet ClarkM-bM-^@M-^] (1967); Don ShebibM-bM-^@M-^Ys breakout film GoinM-bM-^@M-^Y Down the Road (1970); and Roy KiyookaM-bM-^@M-^Ys epistolary poetic volume Transcanada Letters (1975)M-bM-^@M-^Tand the way they use the national highway to realize the failures of CanadaM-bM-^@M-^Ys post-WWII Fordist reconstruction vision. Using the mise-en-abyme structure, these texts frame central narratives with a Trans-Canada Highway trip to simultaneously probe economic and cultural Americanization and recast nationalist potential. This dissertationM-bM-^@M-^Ys focus, then, is on tracing the arrival of different forms of the Anglo-Canadian road narrative and the way these forms alternatively aestheticize evolving Canadian-American relations. M-bM-^@M-^\Open Border, Open RoadM-bM-^@M-^] questions how Canadians, within an Anglo-nationalist context, repeatedly came to see their country anew amid shifting American-Canadian relations in the post-WWII period, and argues for the road narrative as a crucial site for indexing these shifts." ;

    ns3:subject "Chemical Isotope Labeling",
        "Dansylation",
        "Metabolomics" ;
    ns1:abstract "Metabolomics is the study of all the small molecules in a given sample or organism. It is used to understand individual variations caused by the relationship between the individualM-bM-^@M-^Ys genetics, exposome and metabolic activity. There is interest in using metabolomics for personalized care leading to the merging of metabolomics with other fields such as nutritional sciences. These nutrimetabonomic studies focus on the individualM-bM-^@M-^Ys metabolic response to a food or diet.  As a note, metabolomics aims to study the effects of a stimuli on a metabolome while metabolomics involves metabolome fingerprinting of various samples. They are considered interchangeable with the more common use of the word metabolomics to describe most studies. Metabolomics can be used in a targeted or non-targeted manner. For non-targeted metabolomics, the entire set of metabolites is of interest. However, the metabolome is complex containing metabolites with various chemical properties. Profiling the metabolome with one analytical platform is impossible. However, the metabolome can be grouped by similar chemical properties (submetabolomes). Chemical isotope labeling (CIL) can be used to target submetabolomes by addition of an isotope tag to improve separation, ionization efficiency and provide the ability for relative or absolute quantification. In this way, the entire metabolome can be comprehensively studied using one or few analytical platforms such as positive mode reverse phase liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (RPLC-MS). In this work, I used CIL LC-MS to profile the amine and phenol submetabolome of cow milk. Milk is one of the main food groups in North America and is consumed multiple times a day. I first determined a sample cleanup protocol involving protein precipitation with methanol and lipid removal with dichloromethane. Dansylation labeling was utilized to target the amine and phenol submetabolome of cow milk. The differences between brands, batches and fat percentages of cow milk was investigated. Once the metabolome for cow milk was determined, the short-term effects of cow milk consumption on the human urine metabolome was investigated. Each individual was analyzed independently due to large inter-individual differences that masks metabolome changes when the volunteers were analyzed together. By comparing the urine dataset with the previously determined cow metabolome, subtle changes to the urine metabolome after milk consumption were able to be detected with confidence.  The ability of metabolomics to generate metabolome fingerprints can also be useful for quality control or product authentication purposes. Human milk is known as the best source of nutrition for an infant. However, not all mothers are able to produce milk. Human milk sharing has become popular due to easy access and low cost of online purchasing. With the high demand, there is potential for human milk adulteration via dilution with foreign milk in order to increase profits. I used CIL RPLC-MS to profile the metabolome of human milk along with 5 potential human milk adulterants (soy, goat, cow, almond, infant formula). Once the metabolome fingerprints were obtained, the human milk was investigated with varying levels of adulteration (5%, 10%, 25%, 50% and 75%). Overall, I was able to detect as low as 5% adulteration of human milk with foreign milk  When utilizing metabolomics in a targeted manner, a particular metabolite (i.e. propionic acid) or class of metabolites (i.e. short chain fatty acids) are of interest. Absolute quantification can be done for targeted metabolomics of one or a few metabolites if their respective standards are available. In this work, I used p-dimethyaminoacyl (DmPA) bromide to target and absolutely quantify propionic acid. The labeling method was optimized and a RPLC-MS method was tailored for the analysis of propionic acid." ;

    ns2:abstract "Background: The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of biological parameters that have been identified as significant risk factors in the development of cardiovascular disease.  The relevance of MetS to the psychiatric population has been demonstrated in that having severe mental illness (SMI) itself and also being prescribed antipsychotic medications contribute to the development of MetS.  A review of published investigations of non-geriatric general populations suggested that memory, executive functioning, processing speed, and general intellect may be affected by having MetS, with specific MetS factors appearing to correlate with domain-specific cognitive changes.  However, the non-geriatric studies tended to sample older populations and thus remain limited with respect to generalization to children, adolescents and young adults. This study is an exploration of the relationship between MetS and cognitive functioning in a younger population with a psychotic illness.  Based on a review of the literature, we hypothesized that individuals with a psychotic illness and meeting criteria for a diagnosis of MetS would have increased cognitive dysfunction in one or more domains, in addition to the effects of having a psychotic illness alone.  Additionally, we expected impairment in glucose regulation to be associated with impairment of attention and processing speed, and obesity to be associated with impairments in attention, working memory, and visuospatial skills. Methods: Individuals presenting with early psychosis (having less than one year of treatment) to the Edmonton Early Psychosis Intervention Clinic in Edmonton, Alberta were assessed with the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB).  Clinical assessment also included an evaluation of the factors of MetS as defined by the National Cholesterol Education Programs Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP-ATP III) criteria.  Following an exploratory analysis, linear regression analysis was used to identify possible significant relationships between discrete markers of MetS, such as fasting blood glucose, and specific cognitive domains. Results: As only two individuals met criteria for MetS, we moved to analysis of discrete markers of MetS and specific cognitive assessments.  Fasting blood glucose levels were positively associated with spatial working memory (Wechsler Memory Scale-III: Spatial Span) (M-NM-2 = 0.33; t= 2.36; p = 0.02), recall of figures (Brief Visuospatial Memory Test - Revised) (M-NM-2 = 0.30; t =2.15; p = 0.04), and a measure of reasoning and problem solving (Neuropsychological Assessment Battery M-BM-.: Mazes) (M-NM-2 = 0.34; t = 2.41; p = 0.02).  Covariates, such as occupational status, socioeconomic status, years of education, cannabis use, and medication effects did not appear to exert any significant effect on these relationships.  Discussion: This analysis demonstrated that fasting blood glucose values were generally within the normal range in this young sample of individuals suffering a first episode of psychosis, and not associated with measures of sustained attention or processing speed.   Fasting blood glucose values were, however, directly associated with performance on several non-verbal tasks sensitive to spatial working memory, learning and memory of designs, and executive skills related to reasoning and problem solving with spatial materials.  This relationship was not predicted, but the consistency across non-verbal instruments suggests a potentially reliable effect that may implicate relatively circumscribed cerebral effects of glucose in relation to relevant neuroanatomy, and to the shifting pattern of cerebral blood flow during cognitive tasks.  Although provocative, replication will be necessary to gain confidence in the stability of this result and the validity of inferences regarding potential mechanisms that might underlie this association." ;

    ns2:abstract "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, progressive disease that involves neuroinflammation, demyelination, and neurodegeneration within the central nervous system (CNS). While loss of motor function and paralysis are considered the primary clinical consequences of MS, the disease is also associated with a variety of secondary symptoms. One of the most common and debilitating secondary symptoms of MS is pain. The underlying neurobiological mechanisms of pain in MS are poorly understood, and the currently available treatments are generally inadequate. Pain in MS can be studied using the inducible animal disease model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). This thesis focuses on elucidating the cellular and circuit/systems-level mechanisms underlying pain in the MOG35-55/C57/BL6 murine EAE model. Altered neuronal function and structural/synaptic plasticity are characterized within the dorsal horn (DH) and the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) in early EAE, using a variety of optical imaging and immunohistochemical methods. We also assess the effects of treatment with the antidepressant phenelzine (PLZ) on neuronal plasticity and behavioral measures of pain in EAE, and in the formalin model of subacute chemogenic pain. PLZ, which acts to raise CNS levels of the monoamines (5-HT, NA, DA) and GABA, reduced nociceptive responses in the second phase of the formalin model, and reversed allodynia in EAE. PLZ also reversed or attenuated many of the plastic changes that we identified in the CNS in EAE, and acts to restore or augment inhibition in the DH/S1. These experiments identify novel forms of CNS plasticity associated with pain in EAE, and also identify a novel use for PLZ in mitigating this plasticity and treating pain. This work helps validate and advance the use of MOG35-55/C57/BL6 EAE as a model for pain in MS, and may also inform the development of novel pain treatments." ;

    ns5:abstract "Cobalt phosphoranimide clusters [Co(NPPh3)(OSiMe3)(THF)]2, [Co(NPPh3)(OtBu)(THF)]2 and [Co(NPiPr3)2]3 were synthesized. Salt metathesis between CoBr2 and NaNPPh3 and a subsequent in situ reaction with KOSiMe3 provides a convenient and scalable preparation of [Co(NPPh3)(OSiMe3)(THF)]2. The same synthetic route affords the analogous [Co(NPPh3)(OtBu)(THF)]2 from a metathesis reaction with KOtBu but the synthesis suffers from reproducibility issues. An easy, one-step reaction between CoBr2 and NaNPiPr3 gives [Co(NPiPr3)2]3 in high yield. All complexes were characterized by Elemental Analysis and Fourier Transform M-bM-^@M-^S Infrared Spectroscopy. Preliminary catalytic experiments with these clusters found that 4-acetylbiphenyl is deoxygenated overnight at 200 M-BM-0C and 34 atm H2 in the presence of excess KOtBu as a co-catalyst and water scavenger. Aldol condensation and dimerization driven by benzylic radical intermediates occur to a significant extent. Further radical additions produce insoluble oligomers as the major product. Mercury tests revealed that the precatalysts decompose into heterogeneous cobalt nanoparticles under harsh reaction conditions. A deliberate pre-decomposition of clusters [Co(NPPh3)(OSiMe3)(THF)]2 and [Co(NPPh3)2]3 at 200 M-BM-0C and 34 atm H2 yields heterogeneous catalysts that completely deoxygenate 4-acetylbiphenyl using activated 3M-CM-^E molecular sieves to scavenge the resulting H2O. Aldol condensation is suppressed in the base-free reactions; only minor, radical-driven dimerization takes place. The thermally stable phosphoranimide ligands cause slow cluster decomposition but are eventually liberated to produce the active cobalt catalyst. Activation of ligand-free CoBr2 by alkali metal tert-butoxides and a subsequent in situ decomposition at 200 M-BM-0C and 34 atm H2 for 1 h produces the most active catalyst. At 7 atm H2 and 200 M-BM-0C, heterogeneous cobalt particles fully deoxygenate 4-acetylbiphenyl in 2.5 h using molecular sieves to scavenge water. Deoxygenation of deactivated substrates such as 4-fluoroacetophenone requires longer reaction times; the catalyst is inactive towards cleaving unactivated CM-bM-^@M-^SO bonds. The heterogeneous reaction exhibits a strong dependence on the reaction temperature, pressure and reaction time." ;

    ns6:abstract "The last decades witnessed the rapid growth and advancement of research on microfluidic systems for chemical and biological analysis. There remain many important biochemical challenges that need to be solved with novel technologies. This thesis looks at how to apply several microfluidic techniques to several different biochemical problems. For example, one of the key biological problems in directed evolution of biomolecules is that large numbers of cells need to be processed with many repeated steps. A microfluidic cell sorter offers a simple and automated system for cell-based directed evolution. A key challenge in clinical diagnosis especially for point of care analysis is the need to clean up and prepare samples so the matrix does not cause problems in the analysis. Creating a generic clean up system requires we be able to put sample into a device and obtain a cleaned up sample solution as an output. Centrifugal microfluidic system provide this possibility. As a vehicle for development of microfluidic applications, we selected directed evolution of fluorescent proteins (FP) as a target for improvement by a microfluidic cell sorter, and metabolite assays in serum for a test of centrifugal microfluidic sample preparation devices for a M-bM-^@M-^\dirty sample in-clean sample outM-bM-^@M-^] system.  To explore microfluidic fluorescent-activated cell sorting (M-NM-<FACS) system, we first present characterization of such a system with a single point detector, which was developed for screening FPs on the basis of the brightness. The sorting performance is studied for optimal collection efficiency. The expression level of single cells and its effect on directed evolution by the M-NM-<FACS are evaluated. Since the M-NM-<FACS was designed to only screen for the brightness of FPs, other critical parameters of FPs can hardly be improved in the process of directed evolution. We thus introduce a second-generation microfluidic cell sorter with two-point detection system to improve the performance of directed evolution. The new system employs two detectors at two different places to examine the analyte-induced fluorescence change of a FP-based Ca2+ sensor. Both the brightness and fluorescence change are screened in the new system, which demonstrates superior performance in directed evolution compared to the system with single-point detector. Two rounds of directed evolution lead to a variant with improved brightness and g Ca2+-dependent fluorescence change. The Ca2+ sensor is further engineered by rational design and a series of sensors with various Ca2+ affinities are developed for intracellular Ca2+ imaging.  In the second segment of the thesis, we develop a centrifugal microfluidic device to clean small volume (5 M-NM-<L) human serum sample for metabolomics analysis. Sample filtration, drying and mixing are realized on a centrifugal disc. Protein precipitation by methanol and solid phase extraction by C18 beads and silica nanoparticles are utilized to remove proteins and lipids from the sample. The prepared samples are transferred to a solid-matrix laser desorption ionization (SMALDI)-chip which segregates salts from electrolyte background by crystallization during sample drying and then serves as substrate for mass spectrometry analysis. The on-chip assays are optimized to obtain high signal to noise ratio of analyte signals with low background peaks. The reproducibility of the on-chip preparation is evaluated and potential influential factors are discussed. Three ionic metabolites, glutamic acid, aspartic acid and citric acid, are quantitatively analyzed by standard addition method and the results are consistent with samples prepared by ultrafiltration method." ;

    ns1:abstract "This dissertation illuminates how contemporary creative engagements with the evolutionary thinking of Charles Darwin (1809-1882) work to decompose DarwinismM-bM-^@M-^Ys evolutionary aesthetics. Redefining death and decay as a creative threshold for evolutionary progress, this study demonstrates how innovative fiction, film, poetics and art incite a radical reinterpretation of the principles of life, matter, and being in DarwinM-bM-^@M-^Ys natural scientific oeuvre. By contextualizing DarwinM-bM-^@M-^Ys treatises and correspondence in the history of vitalist debates from the nineteenth century to the present, this study identifies four exemplary organisms that foment and sustain decompositional processes: worms, molluscs, corals, and fish. These four case studies are informed by several of DarwinM-bM-^@M-^Ys book-length studies, including The Zoology of the Beagle (1838), The Voyage of the Beagle (1839), The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs (1842), Living Cirripedia and Fossil Cirripedia (1851), On the Origin of Species (1859), and The Formation of Vegetable Mould Through the Action of Worms, With Observations on Their Habits (1881).  Reading DarwinM-bM-^@M-^Ys exploration of life through the lens of decomposition, this dissertation makes two critical interventions. First, it argues that this examination of DarwinM-bM-^@M-^Ys principle of decomposition in turn reforms our understanding of the intellectual lineage of vitalist philosophy that followed in DarwinM-bM-^@M-^Ys wake, particularly in the work of Henri Bergson (1859-1941), along with Gilles Deleuze (1925-1995) and FM-CM-)lix Guattari (1930-1992). Second, it contends that the remarkable collection of film, fiction, poetics and art in this analysis portrays the seen and unseen operations of matter across deep time, both in and through the life/death distinction and the human/animal divide. This study concludes that this vitalist principle of decomposition contributes a new and provocative reinterpretation of Darwinism that has so far gone unnoticed                              ii  in classical studies of Darwin by scholars in the History and Philosophy of Science, and that furthermore has important implications for reorienting treatments of death and animality in the fields of New Materialism, Posthumanism, Animal Studies, and the Environmental Humanities more broadly.  The collection of creative work explored in this study includes Stephen Collis and Jordan Scott's zoopoetic decomposition of Darwin's book, On the Origin of Species, in their poetry collection decomp (2013), A.S. Byatt's neo-Victorian meditation on vegetable mould and the vermiform in Angels and Insects (1992), filmmaker Peter GreenawayM-bM-^@M-^Ys pageantry of putrefaction in A Zed and Two Noughts (1985), Rebecca StottM-bM-^@M-^Ys historical roman M-CM-  clef featuring ancient marine life in The Coral Thief (2008), Jason deCaires TaylorM-bM-^@M-^Ys Anthropocenic underwater coral sculptures (2012-present), Richard FlanaganM-bM-^@M-^Ys colourful post-modern fiction, GouldM-bM-^@M-^Ys Book of Fishes (2001), and novelist Jim CraceM-bM-^@M-^Ys fishy funeral ecology in Being Dead (1999). Each chapter explores how DarwinM-bM-^@M-^Ys fascination with the M-bM-^@M-^\decaying branchesM-bM-^@M-^] and M-bM-^@M-^\fresh budsM-bM-^@M-^] of the great Tree of Life inform our understanding of natural history, and moreover continue to shape our responses to urgent issues of the present day, such as the loss of species biodiversity and the decline of ecological habitats.  In sum, my analysis of these creative divergences of matter across deep time seeks to unearth the impact of Darwin's thinking in literature, film, art, and poetry of the late twentieth and early twenty-first century. This approach is both dialogical and reciprocal. In other words, the texts of this project extend back to Darwin to creatively re-interpret his thinking of lost life forms, but they also invite new ways of reading and representing DarwinismM-bM-^@M-^Ys evolutionary aesthetics in and through the imminent crisis of the Anthropocene." ;

    ns2:abstract "Background: Food insecurity is the limited or uncertain ability to obtain the quantity or quality of food that an individual or household needs due to financial constraints. Food insecurity has been shown to have a variety of negative impacts on health and wellbeing. Post-secondary students represent a group that may be vulnerable to food insecurity, but research in this area is limited. Objectives: The objectives of this research were to review the literature about food insecurity among post-secondary students and explore the qualitative experience of food insecurity among post-secondary students with children. Methods: In study one a narrative review of the literature was conducted using electronic databases and grey literature searches. In study two, face-to-face semi-structured interviews were conducted with food insecure student clients of a Campus-based food bank who had children under the age of 18 in their care. Transcripts underwent conventional content analysis. Results: In study one, 21 studies were included which examined food insecurity in 18,450 students. Prevalence estimates of food insecurity ranged from 12.7 to 89%. Food insecurity risk factors included being low income, living away from home, or being an ethnic minority. A variety of negative consequences of food insecurity were reported (e.g. reduced academic performance, poor diet quality) and strategies to mitigate food insecurity were numerous (e.g. reducing the number or size of meals, borrowing from friends or relatives). In study two a total of nine students were included. All students were full-time students and had 1 (n=7) or 2 children (n=2) under 18-years-old in their care. Due to the breadth of issues examined, data were organized into two separate, but related manuscripts. The first paper examined reasons why students used the food bank; feelings about using the food bank; the consequences of food insecurity for students; and, barriers to students of overcoming food insecurity. The primary impetus for food bank use was in response to a financial crisis that left students with insufficient funds to buy food such as loss of income, shortage in student loan funding, and unexpected bills. Students felt embarrassment, shame or conflicted feelings such as guilt about receiving food hampers. Students experienced negative effects on academic outcomes as well as on mental and social wellbeing. The second paper examined results relating to the impact of food insecurity on the wellbeing of studentsM-bM-^@M-^Y children, the experience with the food received from the Campus Food Bank for students and their children as well as the coping strategies that students with children used to deal with food insecurity. Findings indicate that some students felt that the donated food they received was of poor quality or not appropriate for their culture or religion. Students tried to shield their children from the negative effects of food insecurity by sacrificing their own nutrition in times of food shortage, which included giving children higher quality foods, forfeiting food so children could eat, and ensuring childrenM-bM-^@M-^Ys dietary needs were met before their own. Students used a variety of coping strategies to manage their food insecurity Discussion/Conclusions: Food insecurity is an issue among post-secondary students and is associated with a number of negative outcomes, and warrants further research to determine the causes and consequences of food insecurity in this population. Food insecure students with children experienced a range of negative effects on their academic achievement and mental and social wellbeing and may be at risk for nutritional deficiencies by limiting or varying their own diet in order to ensure their childrenM-bM-^@M-^Ys needs are met.

    ns2:abstract "Virtual reality together with a wheelchair ergometer provide the perfect setting for conducting research involving wheelchair users, rehabilitation for inexperienced wheelchair users, and training wheelchair athletes. The target of this study was to develop a wheelchair ergometer-based virtual reality system that could mimic the biomechanics of real-world wheelchair manoeuvring. In an attempt to do so, a linear inertia system based on a roller ergometer was built based on a thorough biomechanical analysis, and was further equipped with a cube virtual reality environment. In addition, in a developmental manner, three approaches were taken to simulate wheelchair turning, forming three final systems. System I only accommodates linear inertia, assuming the additional inertial effects associated with rotation can be neglected, while system II and III provide compensation for rotational inertia, mechanically and perceptually, in addition to linear inertia. The mechanical system uses a pneumatic braking to add real time resistance against turning, while system III slows down the rotations in virtual reality, corresponding to the rate of turning that happens in the real world where rotational inertia is present. To test the validity and reliability of the systems developed, 15 able-bodied participants were recruited, each performing a series of Illinois agility tests both in RW and in the VR environment. The test-retest reliability of using this agility test was also examined in this study, based on a comprehensive biomechanical analysis assessing 53 variables in total. 94% of the variables tested showed good to excellent ICC, and none of the single-value parameters tested showed a meaningful difference from session one to session two, where the two sessions were at least one week apart (10 days in average). The main objective of this study was to show the reliability and validity of the virtual reality systems developed. Since inexperienced, able-bodied persons using a wheelchair are less likely to be consistent in the way they propel a wheelchair, recruiting them for this study was justifiable. If we could show that inexperienced wheelchair users were consistent from one session to another, and between real and virtual worlds, we could also assume that experienced wheelchair users would also be consistent between these two environments. Test-retest reliability and construct validity of the three systems were examined, using, respectively, ICC for VR systems tried in two different sessions, and Pearson correlation between the data obtained from VR system tests and real-world tests, conducted in the same session. 53 biomechanical variables were tested in total, and as a result, all three systems showed good validity for many of the variables tested. Also, a very good reliability for the System II and good reliability factors for Systems I and III was observed for most of the variables tested. In general, System II was biomechanically the best system while System III delivered a better VR experience. This study also revealed that to finish a manoeuvring task in VR, people use more time, shorter pushes, less pushes, more tangential forces, and less backward pushes relative to real world. To prepare the participants for the experiments, they underwent up to four training sessions to acclimatize to motion sickness. The results of this study showed that a maximum of four sessions held on different days was enough to resolve motion sickness or reduce the susceptibility to it to a well tolerated level. Furthermore, the Motion Sickness Assessment Questionnaire and the Igroup Presence Questionnaire were used to assess participantsM-bM-^@M-^Y motion sickness and feeling of presence in the VR. It was observed that all of the three systems presented relatively low motion sickness and high virtual presence. Also, a meaningful inverse relationship between motion sickness and VR presence was observed." ;

    ns1:abstract "Identification of bacterial isolates is important for taxonomic purposes, as well as to predict behaviour and properties of organisms in evolutionary, ecological, industrial, or medical contexts. This process embraces a polyphasic approach (phenotypic, genotypic, and phylogenetic), but has been ultimately based on comparisons of 16S rRNA gene sequences and genomic DNAM-bM-^@M-^SDNA hybridization (DDH). It was only in the past decade that modern taxonomy has begun the process of incorporating whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data, thanks to significant advancements in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, to perform taxonomic assignments of bacteria. As such, genome-based pairwise similarity indexes were introduced as part of the taxonomic polyphasic approach. This includes multilocus sequence analysis of the core genome, in silico (digital) DDH (dDDH) and average nucleotide identity (ANI) for species delineations, and average amino acid identity (AAI) and the percentage of conserved proteins (POCP) for delineations within higher taxonomic ranks. For this thesis, WGS was employed in characterizing a novel species of Vibrio, Vibrio cidicii, which was only distinguishable from its closest known relative, Vibrio navarrensis, in one phenotypic test. The former, but not the latter, was able to utilize L-rhamnose as a sole carbon source. Pairwise ANI was calculated from the genomes of four isolates of each species, which ranged from 95.4M-bM-^@M-^S95.8% (same-species cutoff for ANI of 95M-bM-^@M-^S96%). Although ANI showed borderline results, pairwise dDDH results were more conclusive and ranged from 61.9M-bM-^@M-^S64.3% (same-species cutoff for DDH is 70%). This was further supported by phylogenetic analysis of the core genome, which placed the V. cidicii isolates into their own monophyletic clade, distinct from V. navarrensis. Whereas dDDH and ANI are becoming more commonly used in species characterizations and specifically demonstrated here to be useful in the characterization of a novel species, higher taxonomic ranks are still mostly circumscribed based on 16S rRNA gene sequence phylogeny. The use of 16S rRNA gene sequences was predominant in identifying organisms within the family Rhodobacteraceae, with the first isolates discovered in the early 1990s, the heyday of sequencing for this marker gene. Within this family is a monophyletic group of organisms called the roseobacter clade, plagued with inconsistencies in nomenclature. In another study described in this thesis, pairwise AAI and POCP were calculated from 290 high-quality whole-genome sequences with the aim of properly delineating genera within this family. Whereas the POCP metric did not show distinct delineations for genus, a cutoff for genus (70%) is proposed based on AAI. Using this cutoff, strains were reclassified to remove polyphyly and paraphyly in some genera. Additionally, we were able to determine 60% AAI as the newly proposed cutoff for family, reclassifying some members into a new family with the proposed name Stappiaceae fam. nov. WGS is useful beyond identification purposes. In a third study described in this thesis, the extent of interspecies horizontal gene transfer (HGT) was determined between two very closely related organisms, Vibrio cholerae and Vibrio metoecus, to demonstrate the role HGT plays in diversification and speciation. Vibrio metoecus is a recently described species that showed high 16S rRNA gene sequence identity with V. cholerae (98%), the causative agent of the potent diarrheal disease cholera. It was previously thought to be an atypical variant of V. cholerae. However, genome comparisons resulted in only 86M-bM-^@M-^S87% ANI between species, indicating that V. metoecus is a different species. Both species were co-isolated in a brackish coastal pond in the United States East Coast, which suggests that they are likely in constant interaction with each other. This presented an opportunity to study interspecies gene exchange in natural populations. Comparative genomic analysis showed a bias in interspecies recombination, where V. metoecus was a recipient of up to three times more genes from V. cholerae as it was the donor. Interestingly, it was determined by qPCR that V. cholerae is three times more abundant in the environment than V. metoecus, and the former was present throughout the summer but the latter was only detectable at the end of the season. This difference in abundance and seasonality could be major contributors in the HGT bias from V. cholerae to V. metoecus. WGS has also shown promise in epidemiological investigations and was proven to be a powerful tool in investigating the origin of the cholera outbreak in Haiti. After the devastating 2010 earthquake in Haiti, cholera spread quickly around the country. Initial epidemiological reports linked the outbreak to the United Nations peacekeeping troops deployed to Haiti from Nepal after news reports showed improper sewage treatment in their camp. Traditional epidemiological investigations were enhanced by WGS and phylogenetic analysis and allowed the determination of the exact source of the outbreak. The clinical V. cholerae isolates from Haiti showed very high genomic resemblance to clinical isolates from Nepal, with only one to two nucleotide differences in their core genome, supporting the hypothesis that pathogenic V. cholerae was imported to Haiti from an external source through human transmission. The various studies presented herein demonstrate the usefulness of WGS in taxonomy, population genetics, and microbial epidemiology. This is made possible by significant advances in NGS technologies as well as sequence analysis methods." ;
