      <note type="public_message">"Baldur Man. Oct. 27/15. Dearest Clara - thanks ever so much for your nice letter rec. this afternoon. We are fine + having a good time. We expect to come home the first of next  week either on Mon. or Sun. We are going to the city on Sat. Will you ask John Roblin to keep an eye on everything around the house especially the wagons on Sat. night ""Halloween"" in case the kids get mischievious around there. It drizzled all day Sun. here and a howling snow storm on mtn. until into the afternoon when it cleared up. That put a stop to the threshing for a while I'm making a bureau scarf out of embroidered hand[?] + lace. I think it's going to be pretty. I knitted a lace which I intend to have around a doily and that bag I told you about and that's all I've done. Lazy, eh? Kind regards to all from us [?] and love to you from Your loving [Irma?]"</note>
