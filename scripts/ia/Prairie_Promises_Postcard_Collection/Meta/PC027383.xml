      <note type="public_message">Coronation all = Canada. Aug. 1. 1913. Dear niece, I rec'd your card. was very pleased to hear from you, [so] we thought you had forgotten us. I wonder if Esther remembers saying she would not be long in answering my letter we wonder what she calls long. Was glad to know your Papa is keeping well. We are all well here. Lizzie was out 4 days last week. John is down on his home stead. Are you going to go to school in L[uirhe] again? I suppose you will have your threshing done now. Our grain is no good. Well write soon. With love from all to all. Your Aunt, Margaret.</note>
