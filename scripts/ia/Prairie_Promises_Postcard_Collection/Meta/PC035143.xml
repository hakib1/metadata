      <note type="public_message">Again this year, 1913, Canada has produced a fine crop. Did you ever stop to consider what a mag-nificent compliment to Canada is the fact that 675,000 Americans have settled in Canada in the last 7 years, and they've stayed there which must mean they are happy and prosperous for the American does not stay where he is not making good. Could you have better proof of Canada's goodness? We tell you that we confidently expect the land we are selling in the Goose Lake District, Saskatchewan will have a valuation of close to $100.00 per acre within in a few years. Our opinion is the same as that of many others who know this fine land and it is founded on a thorough acquaintance for a number of years. We believe you would have the same opinion if you saw it with us and if so it certainly offers you a splendid opportunity for profitable investment. We tell you this because we want you to come with us on our trip leaving St. Paul September 17th. We will give you a reduced rate and furnish good bed and board on our private car at a small price. If you purchase the trip costs you nothing. A fine trip to fine land showing the great 1913 Canadian harvest on the way. Can we make a fairer offer? Will you come? GODART LAND CO. ST. PAUL, MINN.</note>
