<http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/0r/96/76/28/0r967628d> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/abstract> "Petrologic, geochemical, geochronological, and fluid inclusion studies were conducted on the Newton epithermal and Morrison porphyry deposits in central British Columbia, as a part of a large collaborative research project to combine geological, ZTEM, magnetotelluric, and magnetic studies, in order to improve the effectiveness of ZTEM surveys for deep mineral exploration. Newton is an intermediate-sulfidation epithermal gold deposit, which is spatially and genetically related to a Late Cretaceous volcanoplutonic complex. The mineralized felsic volcanic rocks, feldspar-quartz-hornblende porphyry, and quartz-feldspar porphyry from the volcanoplutonic complex yielded U-Pb zircon ages of 72.1 ± 0.6 Ma (Amarc Resources Ltd., unpublished data, reported in McClenaghan, 2013), 72.1 ± 0.48 Ma (new data), and 70.9 ± 0.5 Ma (Amarc Resources Ltd., unpublished data, reported in McClenaghan, 2013), respectively. A barren diorite intrusion yielded a slightly younger U-Pb age of 69.32 ± 0.43 Ma. Gold occurs as electrum and gold-silver telluride, which are present as inclusions in disseminated pyrite and marcasite. Three stages of mineralization are recognized: (1) disseminated pyrite with gold inclusions, and rare quartz-pyrite ± molybdenite veins; (2) disseminated marcasite with gold inclusions; (3) polymetallic pyrite-chalcopyrite-sphalerite-arsenopyrite veins. Molybdenite from a porphyry-hosted stage 1 quartz-calcite-pyrite-molybdenite vein yielded a Re-Os data of 72.1 ± 0.3 Ma (McClenaghan, 2013), which is taken to represent the age of mineralization. A relatively hot and saline hydrothermal fluid was related to stage 1 mineralization, and homogenization temperatures and salinities of fluid inclusions in a stage 1 quartz–pyrite ± molybdenite ± gold vein average 313 ± 51°C (n = 82) and 4.8 ± 0.9 wt.% NaCl equiv. (n = 46), respectively. The predominance of disseminated mineralization suggests that wallrock reaction and cooling were the main controls on gold precipitation, although evidence for boiling was also observed in the veins. Morrison is a typical porphyry Cu-Au-Mo deposit, spatially and genetically related to Eocene plagioclase-hornblende-biotite porphyry intrusions. The porphyry intrusions are part of a calc-alkaline to high-K calc-alkaline diorite to granodiorite intrusive suite with continental arc affinity, and yielded a U-Pb age of 52.21 ± 0.37 Ma. The mineralization can be divided into 3 stages: (1) disseminated and vein-type chalcopyrite-bornite; (2) quartz-molybdenite-pyrite veins; and (3) polymetallic dolomite ± quartz-sphalerite-galena-arsenopyrite-chalcopyrite veins. Molybdenite yielded ages of 52.54 ± 0.22 and 53.06 ± 0.22 Ma, which are broadly consistent with the age of the porphyry intrusions, indicating a genetic relationship. Fluid inclusion (Th = 400 to 526°C; salinity = 39.8 to 47.8 wt.% NaCl equiv.), sulfur isotope (δ34S = -0.2 and 0.8‰ for pyrite and chalcopyrite intergrowths), and oxygen isotope (δ18Ofluid = 3.7 to 6.3‰) data for stage 1 mineralization indicate that the early Cu-Au-bearing fluids were likely of magmatic origin. A cooler and slightly less saline fluid (Th = 320 to 421°C; salinity = 37.0 to 43.1 wt.% NaCl equiv.) was responsible for stage 2 mineralization. Sulfur isotope (δ34S = -2.1 and -1.2‰ for molybdenite and pyrite, respectively) and oxygen isotope (δ18Ofluid = 0.3 to 3.4‰) data from stage 2 minerals suggest a contribution from meteoric groundwater and sediment-derived S to fluids still dominantly of magmatic origin. Stage 3 was associated with cooler and much more dilute fluids (Th = 163° to 218°C; salinity = 3.1 to 3.9 wt.% NaCl equiv.), with oxygen isotopic compositions of δ18Ofluid ≈ -2 to +4‰ from early vein quartz, and 0.8 to 6.3‰ from late vein dolomite, sulfur isotopic compositions for sphalerite and pyrite of δ34S = -7.1 and -5.6‰ (respectively), and carbon isotopic compositions from dolomite of δ13C = 0.6 and 0.7‰. These characteristics suggest that stage 3 fluids were likely dominantly of meteoric water origin (with some wallrock isotopic exchange), and derived C and S from the sedimentary country rocks. The results of this study will be used to constrain geological and petrophysical models that are being developed to improve the effectiveness of ZTEM surveys." .
