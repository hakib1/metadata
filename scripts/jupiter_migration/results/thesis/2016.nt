<http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/c5/h7/3p/w0/c5h73pw08n> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/abstract> "Vaccines bring many diseases under control, an example of which is the Streptococcus pneumoniae, or the Pneumococcus. Pneumococcus is one of the leading causes of meningitis in children under 5 years, and is responsible for almost a million child deaths annually, with more than 90 serotypes identified. The discovery of antigenicity of the capsular polysaccharide (CPS) is the basis for current Pneumococcus vaccines, as it is used as a serotype specific polysaccharide-only vaccine. These were reported to be effective in adults, but not in young children under 5 years. Glycoconjugate vaccines, where CPS subunits are conjugated to immunogenic proteins, revolutionized immunization against the Pneumococcus, as their efficacy was demonstrated in young children. A Pneumococcus conjugate vaccine was first introduced in the year 2000 against 7 serotypes. This vaccine has shown exceptional efficacy and is produced by chemically conjugating CPS to an immunogenic protein. This process has a lot of drawbacks including product heterogeneity and high costs. Bacterial glycosylation systems have been used as an alternative to overcome these drawbacks and produce affordable vaccines. A problem with that is the glycan and protein specificity of the conjugating enzymes, the oligosaccharyltransferases (OTases). Continuous probing for OTases with different specificities is essential for driving the glycoconjugate industry forward. In this thesis, we characterize the protein O-linked glycosylation system of members of the genus Acinetobacter. O-linked glycosylation is mediated by O-OTases, enzymes that transfer glycans from a lipid carrier to serine and threonine residues of acceptor proteins. We employ the clinical isolate A. nosocomialis M2 and the environmental isolate A. baylyi ADP1 to show that most Acinetobacter spp. encode two O-OTases with different acceptor protein specificities, contrary to previously characterized O-glycosylation systems which encode a single O-OTase. One of these OTases is specific for Type IV pilin (Tfp) glycosylation and the other one glycosylates multiple proteins. Pilin-specific OTases in Acinetobacter resemble the TfpO O-OTase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa whereas general OTases resemble the Neisseria meningitidis PglL. A. baylyi is an exception however, as both OTases are closely related to PglL with one being a general OTase and the other specific for glycosylation of the Tfp-like protein ComP. In the second part of this thesis, we attempt to exploit the A. baylyi PglLs in the glycoconjugate vaccine industry. We characterize the glycan specificity which is believed to depend on the sugar residue at the reducing end of the glycan, the first sugar added to the lipid carrier and the one in contact with serine or threonine residues of acceptor proteins. We show that both PglLs have very similar glycan specificity to the well-characterized PglL from Neisseria meningitidis. We also show that only one of the PglLs, designated PglLComP, successfully transfers Pneumococcus CPS subunits to the acceptor protein ComP. Pneumococcus CPS have a glucose residue at the reducing end and were never demonstrated to be transferred by the previously identified OTases. This is an unprecedented finding that greatly expands the tools available for glycoengineering." .

<http://gillingham.library.ualberta.ca:8080/fedora/rest/prod/cm/k6/1r/g9/cmk61rg99k> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/abstract> "This Thesis consists of two papers that explore the use of Electronic Medical Record (EMR) systems in resource-limited settings. The first paper (Chapter 2) comprises a State-of-the-Art review of the types of inquiry, settings, interventions and principal findings reported from studies of the benefits, challenges and impact of EMRs in resource-constrained environments in Sub-Saharan Africa.  A systematically developed search strategy was applied to formal bibliographic databases and to grey literature retrieved with Internet search engines to yield 946 distinct communications.  These were classified by literature type, method of inquiry, setting, interventions and outcomes.  A subset of the most applicable articles was reviewed for principle findings from which an analytic framework was derived. This classified current knowledge into claims about the effects of systems (e.g., power, Internet, network infrastructure), people (e.g., recruitment and retention), processes (e.g., training, change management) and products (e.g., software features, user interface). The second paper (Chapter 3) reports use of descriptive qualitative methods to explore perceptions of front-line staff about the use, benefits, challenges and impact of an EMR deployed in two primary care clinics in Kibera, one of East Africa’s largest urban slums. Observations were categorized, then grouped into three major themes relating to matters of infrastructure, software, and social and organizational.  One overarching theme, sustainability, permeated all categories. Although the diverse Kibera infrastructure and software challenges might have been anticipated from knowledge about conditions for successful EMR implementation, an unequivocal participant emphasis on organizational (social and cultural) considerations yielded specific observations about unique challenges to EMR use in slum settings. These and other observations were combined to form a pre- and post-implementation checklist. The checklist summarize learnings from both the literature review and the field study.  Given the paucity of published reports about EMR effects in slum settings, this work will hopefully be of particular interest to clinicians and organizations working in resource-constrained settings. Many of the benefits and challenges found in this study resonate with observations originating in developed countries.  Unique field findings reported here may facilitate the design and conduct of future studies about barriers and facilitators to EMR use in slum settings." .
