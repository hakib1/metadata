The GAP SSHRC communities in ERA offer easy access to successful grant proposals, workshop materials and other resources relevant to enabling success in applications to competitions sponsored by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council. Similar communities are established for the GAP NSERC and GAP CIHR. The documents in the GAP SSHRC community are keyword tagged. See below for a listing of preferred keywords.
