However, factors that may affect reliability have yet to be investigated. The objective of this study was to compare the: 1) within- and between-day reliability of a mechanical indentation device (MID) in measuring spinal stiffness, 2) measurement precision of averaging multiple measurements, and 3) reliability of stiffness measurements between individuals with and without low back pain (LBP). The spinal stiffness of 26 volunteers with and without LBP was measured 3 times by MID in each of two visits 1e4 days apart. Two stiffness measures were calculated from the resulting force-displacement data: global stiffness and terminal stiffness. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were used to estimate reliability. Measurement precision was measured by minimal detectable changes, bias and 95% limits of agreement. Using the mean of three spinal stiffness measurements, the measurement precision was improved by 33.7% over a single measurement. Averaging three measurements, the within- and between-day reliability point estimates of both global and terminal stiffness were 0.99 and 0.98, respectively. The reliability estimates of spinal stiffness measurement using MID were not significantly altered by the participants’ LBP status across all circumstances (95% confidence intervals overlapped). With our experimental protocol, averaging three spinal stiffness measurements using MID produces reliable stiffness measurements regardless of individuals’ LBP status." .

OBJECTIVES: To compare the within- and between-day intra-rater reliability of rehabilitative ultrasound imaging (RUSI) using static images (RUSIs) and video clips (RUSIvc) in quantifying multifidus muscle thickness at rest and while contracted. The secondary objectives were to compare the measurement precision of averaging multiple measures, and the reliability estimates in individuals with and without low back pain (LBP). BACKGROUND: Although intra-rater reliability of RUSIs in measuring multifidus thickness has been established, using RUSIvc may improve reliability estimates as examiners may select the optimal image from the video clip. Further, multiple measurements, and LBP status may affect RUSI reliability estimates. METHODS: RUSIs and RUSIvc were used to quantify multifidus muscle thickness at rest and during contraction, and percent thickness change in 27 volunteers (13 without LBP, and 14 with LBP). Three RUSIs and three RUSIvc were collected in each of two sessions 1 to 4 days apart. Reliability and precision were assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), standard error of measurement, minimal detectable change, bias and 95% limits of agreement. RESULTS: Using an average of two measures yielded optimal measurement precision for RUSIs and RUSIvc. Based on the average of two measures obtained under the same circumstance, there was no significant difference in the reliability estimates between RUSIs and RUSIvc across all testing conditions. Reliability point estimates (ICC3,2) of multifidus thickness were 0.99 for within-day comparisons and ranged from 0.93 to 0.98 for between-day comparisons. The within- and between-day ICC3,2 of percent thickness change ranged from 0.97 to 0.99, and 0.80 to 0.90, respectively. The exploratory analysis showed no significant difference in the reliability estimates between asymptomatic and LBP participants across most testing conditions. CONCLUSION: Both RUSI methods yielded high reliability estimates for multifidus muscle measurements. Using the average of two measures obtained optimal measurement precision. Overall, RUSIvc is a reliable surrogate of RUSIs for multifidus muscle measurements with an additional advantage of shorter duration of data collection." .
