Accompanying audio CDs were excluded from the research. Twelve texts were beginner through advanced-level student books and four were teachers’ manuals. All of the textbooks were published after 2004. The student texts were analyzed to determine the extent to which activities were communicative, contextualized, and spiraled. Instructional foci were examined for percentages of activities related to perception, production, segmental, and suprasegmental features. Findings suggested that percentages varied greatly between textbooks and across individual series. The teachers’ manuals were reviewed for teaching tips, instructions, and pedagogical content. Results indicated that a broad array of information was imparted. Some manuals provided helpful teaching tips, explicit instructions, and pedagogical rationale for activities while others offered limited advice and reminders for instructors to monitor their learners’ pronunciation. Given that many ESL educators lack formal training in pronunciation, tables summarizing the findings in this study and an annotated bibliography were created to assist ESL instructors when choosing pronunciation-specific textbooks." .
