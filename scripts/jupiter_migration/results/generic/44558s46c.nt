However, re-establishment of the forest understory community has proven challenging when using conventional reclamation techniques because of limited availability of native seed propagules.
To overcome some of these challenges, direct placement of forest floor material – where salvaged soils are transferred directly to a reclamation site – has been encouraged. This technique preserves native propagules in soils and can improve forest recovery. However, an important question remains: what soil salvage depth provides the greatest ecological benefit?" .
